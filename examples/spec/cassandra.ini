 This sets the number of memtable flush writer threads per disk

 These are generally a combination of compute and IO bound.

 Memtable flushing is more CPU efficient than memtable ingest and a single thread
 can keep up with the ingest rate of a whole server on a single fast disk
 until it temporarily becomes IO bound under contention typically with compaction.
 At that point you need multiple flush threads. At some point in the future
 it may become CPU bound all the time.

 You can tell if flushing is falling behind using the MemtablePool.BlockedOnAllocation
 metric which should be 0, but will be non-zero if threads are blocked waiting on flushing
 to free memory.

 This means that two  memtables can be flushed concurrently to the single data directory.
 If you have multiple data directories the default is one memtable flushing at a time
 but the flush will use a thread per data directory so you will get two or more writers.

 Two is generally enough to flush on a fast disk [array] mounted as a single data directory.
 Adding more flush writers will result in smaller more frequent flushes that introduce more
 compaction overhead.

 There is a direct tradeoff between number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently
 and flush size and frequency. More is not better you just need enough flush writers
 to never stall waiting for flushing to free memory."

 Cassandra provides two out-of-the-box options for the RPC Server:

   per thread, and that will correspond to your use of virtual memory (but physical memory
   may be limited depending on use of stack space).

 hsha
   Stands for 'half synchronous, half asynchronous.' All thrift clients are handled
   asynchronously using a small number of threads that does not vary with the amount
   of thrift clients (and thus scales well to many clients). The rpc requests are still
   synchronous (one thread per active request). If hsha is selected then it is essential
   that rpc_max_threads is changed from the default value of unlimited.

 sync is about 30% slower on Windows with hsha.  On Linux,

 endpoint_snitch -- Set this to a class that implements
 IEndpointSnitch.  The snitch has two functions:

 - it teaches Cassandra enough about your network topology to route
   requests efficiently
 - it allows Cassandra to spread replicas around your cluster to avoid
   correlated failures. It does this by grouping machines into
   'datacenters' and 'racks.'  Cassandra will do its best not to have
   more than one replica on the same 'rack' (which may not actually
   be a physical location)

 CASSANDRA WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SWITCH TO AN INCOMPATIBLE SNITCH
 ONCE DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER.  This would cause data loss.
 This means that if you start with SimpleSnitch, which
 locates every node on 'rack1' in 'datacenter1', your only options
 if you need to add another datacenter are GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
 (and the older PFS).  From there, if you want to migrate to an
 incompatible snitch like Ec2Snitch you can do it by adding new nodes
 under Ec2Snitch (which will locate them in a new 'datacenter') and
 decommissioning the old ones.

 Out of the box, Cassandra provides:

 SimpleSnitch:
    Treats Strategy order as proximity. This can improve cache
    locality when disabling read repair.  Only appropriate for
    single-datacenter deployments.

 GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
    This should be your go-to snitch for production use.  The rack
    and datacenter for the local node are defined in
    cassandra-rackdc.properties and propagated to other nodes via
    gossip.  If cassandra-topology.properties exists, it is used as a
    fallback, allowing migration from the PropertyFileSnitch.

 PropertyFileSnitch:
    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
    explicitly configured in cassandra-topology.properties.

 Ec2Snitch:
    Appropriate for EC2 deployments in a single Region. Loads Region
    and Availability Zone information from the EC2 API. The Region is
    treated as the datacenter, and the Availability Zone as the rack.
    Only private IPs are used, so this will not work across multiple
    Regions.

 Ec2MultiRegionSnitch:
    Uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region
    connectivity.  (Thus, you should set seed addresses to the public
    IP as well.) You will need to open the storage_port or
    ssl_storage_port on the public IP firewall.  (For intra-Region
    traffic, Cassandra will switch to the private IP after
    establishing a connection.)

 RackInferringSnitch:
    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's IP
    address, respectively.  Unless this happens to match your
    deployment conventions, this is best used as an example of
    writing a custom Snitch class and is provided in that spirit.

 You can use a custom Snitch by setting this to the full class name
 of the snitch, which will be assumed to be on your classpath."

 Coalescing multiples messages turns out to significantly boost message processing throughput (think doubling or more).
 On bare metal, the floor for packet processing throughput is high enough that many applications won't notice, but in
 virtualized environments, the point at which an application can be bound by network packet processing can be
 surprisingly low compared to the throughput of task processing that is possible inside a VM. It's not that bare metal
 doesn't benefit from coalescing messages, it's that the number of packets a bare metal network interface can process
 is sufficient for many applications such that no load starvation is experienced even without coalescing.
 There are other benefits to coalescing network messages that are harder to isolate with a simple metric like messages
 per second. By coalescing multiple tasks together, a network thread can process multiple messages for the cost of one
 trip to read from a socket, and all the task submission work can be done at the same time reducing context switching
 and increasing cache friendliness of network message processing.

will be appropriate. A smaller value could potentially expire messages slightly sooner at the expense of more CPU
time and queue contention while iterating the backlog of messages.
An interval of 0 disables any wait time, which is the behavior of former Cassandra versions."
