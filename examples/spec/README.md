# Spec Files

This tutorial explains how to mount and use specification files.
In particular it will cover:

1.) the [kdb mount-spec(1) command](/doc/help/kdb-spec-mount.md)
2.) the [spec plugin](/src/plugins/spec/)

The tutorial will extensively refer to the `ini` files that are
present in [this folder](/examples/spec/), so make sure they
are accessible for you.
