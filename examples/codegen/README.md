This folder contains three examples for the code-generation part of the high-level API.

- `econf` shows how simple flat configurations (or with a fixed nesting level) can be read.
- `tree` demonstrates how a more complicated configuration with a recursive structure is used.
- `menu` demonstrates the same features as `tree` but is a bit more realistic.
