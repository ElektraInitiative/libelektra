# Shell Recorder #

## Configuration ##

### Plugins: ###

List all plugins you need in the test case. Separated by semicolon.

### Mountpoint: ###

This is the only configuration Variable that has to be set. It is used to determine where the shell_recorder should look for changes.
e.g. `Mountpoint: user/test` tells the shell_recorder that you will be working under `user/test`.

### DiffType: ###

Available:

`Dump`, `Ini` exports the keys below `Mountpoint` using either the dump or ini format and diffs the changes.
`File` does a diff on the configuration file mounted to `Mountpoint`.

### File: ###

Tells the shell_recorder what file to use for diffs.
If File is preset but empty a fresh database temp file will be provided for every run.


## Checks ##

Posix-extended regex is used to check and validate return values and outputs.

**Remark:** Shell Recorder uses the `⏎` symbol as line terminator. This means that you need to use the character `⏎`  (instead of `\n`) if you want to match a line ending in a multiline output. For example: Assume there are exactly two keys with the name `key1` and `key2` located under the path `user/test`. The output of the command `kdb ls user/test` would then be the following

```
user/test/key1
user/test/key2
```

You can check this exact output in a shell recorder script via the following code:

```
STDOUT: user/test/key1⏎user/test/key2
< ls user/test
```

If you only want to check that `key1` and `key2` are part of the output you can use the regex `key1.*key2` instead:

```
STDOUT: key1.*key2
< ls user/test
```

As you can see the line ending is considered  a normal character (`.`) in the output.

Options:

* STDOUT:
* STDERR:
* RET:
* WARNINGS:
* ERRORS:
* DIFF:

## Commands ##

A command starts with `<` followed by the usual kdb commands.


## Examples ##

### Basic ###

This testcase uses the dump-format to validate database changes. the first DIFF tells the shell recorder to watch for the line `> keyNew.*user/test/key3` in the diff of the config files after the command `kdb set /test/key val` is executed. The second DIFF + set work the same, but, because this time the line `> keyNew.*user/test/key3` can't be found in the diff, yields an error
```
 % cat db_changes.dat

DiffType: Dump
