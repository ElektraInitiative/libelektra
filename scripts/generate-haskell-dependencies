# @brief Generates the cabal install command for installing
# all required haskell dependencies to a custom sandbox location
# Please note that this is intended for developers to easily generate
# a list of all required dependencies to be included into
# - scripts/docker/debian/stretch/Dockerfile
# - src/bindings/haskell/README.md
# For the correct resolution it requires that the project
# has already been built once as cmake will configure the cabal files
# @date 17.05.2018
# @tags dependencies
