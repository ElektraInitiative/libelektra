# QUICK INTRODUCTION:
# > To add a binding the following steps have to be performed:
#   - call "check_binding_included ()": this prints exclusion messages based on categories
#   - based on dependency checks
#    a) call "exclude_binding ()": this prints a custom exclusion message
#    b) call "add_binding ()": this prints the inclusion message
#
# > To check if a binding is built there are two options:
#   - General check (i.e. is this binding included by categories): "check_binding_included ()"
#   - Check if "add_binding ()" was called: "check_binding_was_added ()"
#     Note that this only works after the CMake has processed the scripts in
#     "bindings" directory. As a result this only works for CMake scripts in the
#     "tools", "include" and "plugins" (ADDTESTING_PHASE) directories.
#
# ~~~

# ~~~
# - Adds a binding if it is included in BINDINGS and not excluded by name or
#   category (infos/status or infos/provides from it's README.md).
#
#   If the binding is excluded the reason is printed along with the binding name.
#
#   This is function can be used anywhere since the base directory is fixed to
#   the bindings source directory. However if the binding uses subdirectories
#   (like swig, gi or io) you need to supply the correct SUBDIRECTORY option
#   (see examples).
#
# check_binding_included (BINDING_NAME OUTVARIABLE)
#
# BINDING_NAME:
#   name of the binding
#
# OUTVARIABLE:
#   variable that is set to true if binding was added
#
# SILENT:
#   suppress exclusion message
#
# Additional options are passed to check_item_is_excluded ().
# Default for SUBDIRECTORY is BINDING_NAME
#
# Example:
#   check_binding_included ("swig_python" IS_INCLUDED SUBDIRECTORY "swig/python")
#   if (IS_INCLUDED)
#     add_subdirectory (python)
