# @brief run randoop on the jna bindings
# @date 29.10.2017
# @tags test java jna

#
# Executes the test generation tool randoop (https://randoop.github.io/randoop/)
# against the jna bindings with a standard configuration.
#
# Needs java to be accessible in the environment.
# Furthermore it expects the complete randoop bundle including its dependencies,
# which is called randoop-all-<version>.jar . It can be obtained from the randoop
# website mentioned above.
# By default it expects randoop-all-3.1.5.jar to be located in this directory.
# The jna bindings are expected to be in /usr/share/java on linux and
# /usr/local/share/java on macOS.
#
# You can pass a custom location for the two files by calling this script like:
#
# ./randoop [path to randoop jar] [path to libelektra jar]
# e.g.
# ./randoop /Users/admin/Downloads/randoop-3.1.5/randoop-all-3.1.5.jar \
# /usr/local/share/java/libelektra5j-0.8.19.jar
#
# In case you have the required files in the standard paths, simply call ./randoop
#
