/**
 * @defgroup key Key
 *
 * @brief Key is an essential class that encapsulates key @link keyname name @endlink,
 * @link keyvalue value @endlink and @link keymeta metainfo @endlink.
 *
 * To use it include:
 * @code
#include <kdb.h>
 * @endcode
 *
 * Key properties are:
 * - @link keyname Key name @endlink
 * - @link keyvalue Key value @endlink
 * - @link keymeta Key metadata @endlink, including but not limited to:
 *   - @link keyGetComment() Key comment @endlink
 *   - @link keyGetOwner() Key owner @endlink
 *   - @link keymeta UID, GID and filesystem-like mode permissions @endlink
 *   - @link keymeta Mode, change and modification times @endlink
 *
 * @par ABI
 * Due to ABI compatibility, the @p Key structure is not defined in kdb.h,
 * only declared. So you can only declare @p pointers to @p Keys in your
 * program, and allocate and free memory for them with keyNew()
 * and keyDel() respectively.
 *
 *
 * @par Reference Counting
 * Every key has its reference counter (see keyGetRef() for longer
 * explanation) that will be initialized
 * with 0, that means a subsequent call of keyDel() will delete
 * the key. If you append the key to a keyset the reference counter
 * will be incremented by one (see keyIncRef()) and the key can't be
 * deleted by a keyDel().
 *
 * @par
 * As you can imagine this refcounting allows you to put the Key in your
 * own data structures.
 * It can be a very powerful feature, e.g. if you need your own-defined
 * ordering or different Models of your configuration.

/**
 * A practical way to fully create a Key object in one step.
 *
 * To just get a key object, simple do:
 *
 * @snippet keyNew.c Simple
 *
 * keyNew() allocates memory for a key object and keyDel() cleans
 * everything up.
 *
 * We can also give an empty key name and a KEY_END tag with the same
 * effect as before:
 *
 * @snippet keyNew.c Alternative
 *
 * But we can also give the key a proper name right from the start:
 *
 * @snippet keyNew.c With Name
 *
 * If you want the key object to contain a name, value, comment and other
 * meta info read on.
 *
 * @note When you already have a key with similar properties its
 * easier to keyDup() the key.
 *
 * You can call keyNew() in many different ways depending on the attribute tags you
 * pass as parameters. Tags are represented as #keyswitch_t values, and
 * tell keyNew() which Key attribute comes next.
 * The Key attribute tags are the following:
 * - ::KEY_VALUE \n
 *   Next parameter is a pointer to the value that will be used.
 *   If no ::KEY_BINARY was used before, a string is assumed.
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Value
 * - ::KEY_SIZE \n
 *   Define a maximum length of the value. This is only used when setting
 *   a binary key.
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Size
 * - ::KEY_META \n
 *   Next two parameter is a metaname and a metavalue. See keySetMeta().
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Meta
 * - ::KEY_END \n
 *   Must be the last parameter passed to keyNew(). It is always
 *   required, unless the @p keyName is 0.
 * - ::KEY_FLAGS \n
 *   Bitwise disjunction of flags, which don't require one or more values.
 *   recommended way to set multiple flags. overrides previously defined flags.
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Flags
 * - ::KEY_BINARY \n
 *   Allows one to change the key to a binary key.
 *   Make sure that you also pass ::KEY_SIZE before you set the value.
 *   Otherwise it will be cut off with first \\0 in the string.
 *   So this flag toggle from keySetString() to keySetBinary().
 *   If no value (nor size) is given, it will be a NULL key.
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Binary
 * - ::KEY_CASCADING_NAME allow the name to start with /
 *   useful for ksLookup() and kdbGet() parent/lookup keys
 * - ::KEY_META_NAME allow the name to start with arbitrary namespaces
 *   useful to compare with metakeys
 *
 *
 *
 * @deprecated The flags below are deprecated and ::KEY_META should be
 * preferred. They remain some time, however, for compatibility:
 * - ::KEY_DIR \n
 *   Define that the key is a directory rather than an ordinary key.
 *   This means its executable bits in its mode are set.
 *   But even without this option the key can have subkeys.
 *   See keySetDir().
 * - ::KEY_OWNER \n
 *   Next parameter is the owner. See keySetOwner().
 * - ::KEY_UID, ::KEY_GID \n
 *   Next parameter is taken as the UID (uid_t) or GID (gid_t) that will
 *   be defined on the key.
 *   See keySetUID() and keySetGID().
 * - ::KEY_MODE \n
 *   Next parameter is taken as mode permissions (int) to the key.
 *   See keySetMode().
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Mode
 * - ::KEY_COMMENT \n
 *   Next parameter is a comment. See keySetComment().
 *   @snippet keyNew.c With Everything
 *
 *
 *
 * @param name a valid name to the key, or NULL to get a simple

/**
 * Copy or Clear a key.
 *
 * Most often you may prefer keyDup() which allocates
 * a new key and returns a duplication of another key.
 *
 * But when you need to copy into an existing key, e.g.
 * because it was passed by a pointer in a function
 * you can do so:
 *
 * @snippet keyCopy.c Basic Usage
 *
 * The reference counter will not be changed for
 * both keys. Affiliation to keysets
 * are also not affected.
 *
 * The metadata will be duplicated for the destination
 * key. So it will not take much additional space, even
 * with lots of metadata.
 *
 * When you pass a NULL-pointer as source the
 * data of dest will be cleaned completely
 * (except reference counter, see keyClear()) and
 * you get a fresh dest key:
 *
 * @snippet keyCopy.c Clear
 *
 * If you want to copy everything, except e.g. the value
 * you can use keyCopy() too:
 *
 * @snippet keyCopy.c Copy Without Value
 *
 * Restrain from coping everything yourself, because it will lead to
 * wrong metadata and is not able to copy empty or cascading names:
 *
 * @snippet keyCopy.c Individual Copy
 *
 *
 * @param dest the key which will be written to
 * @param source the key which should be copied
 *     or NULL to clean the destination key

 *     was passed for dest or a dynamic property could not
