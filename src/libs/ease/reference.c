 *  - references starting with anything but './', '../' and '@/' as absolute,
 *    only embedded '/./' and '/../' as well as '/.' and '/..' at the end will
 *    be resolved (like in any keySetName call)
 *
 * @param reference The reference to resolve
 * @param baseKey   The key identified by the reference "./"
 * @param parentKey The key identified by the reference "@/"
 *
 * @return a newly allocated string, containing the full keyname;
 *         has to be disposed with elektraFree()
