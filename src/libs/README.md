elektra-libs(7) -- libs overview
================================

## DESCRIPTION

Since version **[0.8.15](/doc/decisions/library_split.md)** **[libelektra](elektra/)**
is split into following libraries:

![Overview of Libraries](/doc/images/overview_libs.png)

### Loader

**[loader](loader/)** contains source files that implement the plugin
loader functionality. The files are linked to **[libelektra](elektra/)**.

### Libease

    libelektra-ease.so

**[libease](ease/)** contains data-structure operations on top of libcore which do not depend on internals.
Applications and plugins can choose to not link against it if they want to stay minimal.

### Libplugin

    libelektra-plugin.so

**[libplugin](plugin/)** contains `elektraPlugin*` symbols and plugins should link against it.

### Libproposal

    libelektra-proposal.so

**[libproposal](proposal/)** contains functions that are proposed for libcore. Depends on internas of libcore and as
such must always fit to the exact same version.

### Libmeta

    libelektra-meta.so

**[libmeta](meta/meta.c)** contains metadata operations as described in **[METADATA.ini](/doc/METADATA.ini)**.
Will be code-generated in the future, so methods should be mechanical reflections
of the contents in **[METADATA.ini](/doc/METADATA.ini)**.

### Libcore

    libelektra-core.so
    <kdbhelper.h>
    <kdb.h> (key* and ks*)

Contains the fundamental data-structures every participant of Elektra needs
to link against. It should be the only part that access the internal
data structures.

### Libtools

**[libtools](tools/)** is a high-level C++ shared-code for tools. It includes:

- plugin interface
- backend interface
- 3-way merge

### Libinvoke

    libelektra-invoke.so

**[libinvoke](invoke/)** provides a simple API allowing us to call functions exported by plugins.
