# In future this may be used for ABI-checking tools.
#
# The contents of this group may change at any time. Only symbols that are actually
# used outside their library should be contained.
# For example:
# If keySetupNew is declared in kdbprivate.h but only used inside of elektra-core,
# we don't declare it here. This way only elektra-core can use keySetupNew. Anything
# that has to be linked against elektra-core will not be able to use keySetupNew.
#
# The version should never be changed, but the based version (second line)
# should always refer to the newest version.
#
# The 'private' suffix marks this version as private. This has the effect that a
# 'local: *' part is generated.
