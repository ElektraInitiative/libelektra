Elektra provides many ways to interact with its global key database.

## CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) is called `kdb`.
It has build-in commands that can be listed via `kdb`.
Additionally, new commands can be easily extended in any language.
These external commands can be listed via `kdb list-tools`

## GUI

The graphical user interface (GUI) is called `kdb qt-gui`.

## Programmatic

Finally, programming languages supported via bindings can
be used to interact with Elektra.
For type safety we recommend the code generator `kdb gen`.
