# TODO: Documentation

## Requirements:

    - The plugin needs Flex (TODO: min version) and Bison (TODO: min version).

## Limitations:

    - Leap seconds for RFC3339 date times are not checked. For seconds, a value of 60 is always valid.
      As a result of this decision, no valid RFC3339 date is determined invalid, but invalid RFC3339 dates may be determined valid.
      Leap seconds can occur on the ends of June/Dec, where a time of 23:59:60 (positive leap second) or 23:59:58 (negative leap second) is the highest valid value for a second.

## Questions

    - Don't know where/how exactly to store trailing array comments/newline info
        * Can't associate those info to array top key in the way like file ending comments are preserved
        * Maybe add own metakey (eg. epilogue/comment/#1)?

## TODOs

    - Order metakeys for file recreation
    - Type metakeys
    - Use date plugin
