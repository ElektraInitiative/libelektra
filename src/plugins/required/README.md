## Introduction

Rarely you want a very strict validation where only required
keys should be accepted.

This plugin rejects every configuration where keys which are
not required are present.

In general this technique is not recommended because it
would lead to rejection of any optional parameter that is
introduced in later versions, hindering upgradability.
Nevertheless, if you need such a feature, this is the
correct plugin to do so.

## Usage

The plugin is _not_ mounted by default.
So you must explicitly add it with `infos/needs`
either in specifications or contracts.

## Example

If you used [simplespeclang](/src/plugins/simplespeclang) and want to
only allow keys that are present in the specification, you can add `required`
to the `spec-mount` command:

```sh
kdb mount test.spec spec/test simplespeclang
cat << HERE > `kdb file spec/test`
plugins required
enum allowed = something
HERE
kdb spec-mount /test
kdb set /test/allowed something    # is specified, works!
kdb set /test/rejected  something  # fails because rejected not required
```
