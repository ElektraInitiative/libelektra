## Introduction

The plugin logs successful and failed write attempts via the systemd journal daemon (systemd-journal).
See the [systemd-journal manpage](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) for more information about systemd-journal.
Errors are reported with priority 3 (error priority) and use the message ID `fb3928ea453048649c61d62619847ef6`.
Successful writes are reported with priority 5 (notice priority) and use the message ID `fc65eab25c18463f97e4f9b61ea31eae`.

Configure the plugin with `log/get=1` to enable logging when configuration is
loaded. For example, `kdb gmount journald log/get=1`.
