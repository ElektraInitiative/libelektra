## Introduction

Includes constants information into the key database. The constants are defined during CMake build.

The plugin is readonly.

## Usage

To mount it, use

```sh
kdb mount -R noresolver none user/tests/constants constants
```

To list all constants, use:

```sh
kdb ls user/tests/constants
