## Introduction

The `blockresolver` can be used to only resolve a tagged block inside a configuration file.

### Implementation details

`blockresolver` extracts the requested block from the configurations file and writes it into a temporary file. Afterwards Elektra will only work on the temporary file until kdbSet is called. On kdbSet the contents of the temporary file will be merged with parts outside of the requested block from the original file.

## Usage

    `kdb mount -R blockresolver /path/to/my/file /mountpoint -c identifier="identifier-tag"`

where `identifier` specifies the tag `blockresolver` will search for in the configuration file.

A block consists of 2 parts:
- beginning: the identifier suffixed with `start`
- end: the identifier suffixed with `stop`

## Limitations

Currently the identifier must be unique.

## Example
```sh
# Backup-and-Restore:system/examples/blockresolver
sudo kdb mount -R blockresolver /tmp/test.block system/examples/blockresolver -c identifier=">>> block config" ini

# create testfile
echo 'text'                   >  /tmp/test.block
echo 'more text'              >> /tmp/test.block
echo 'some more text'         >> /tmp/test.block
echo '>>> block config start' >> /tmp/test.block
echo '[section1]'             >> /tmp/test.block
echo 'key1 = val1'            >> /tmp/test.block
echo '[section2]'             >> /tmp/test.block
echo 'key2 = val2'            >> /tmp/test.block
echo '>>> block config stop'  >> /tmp/test.block
echo 'text again'             >> /tmp/test.block
echo 'and more text'          >> /tmp/test.block
echo 'text'                   >> /tmp/test.block

# check testfile
cat /tmp/test.block
#> text
#> more text
#> some more text
#> >>> block config start
#> [section1]
#> key1 = val1
#> [section2]
#> key2 = val2
#> >>> block config stop
#> text again
#> and more text
#> text

# only the block between the tags is read!
kdb export system/examples/blockresolver ini
#> [section1]
#> key1 = val1
#> [section2]
#> key2 = val2

# add a new key to the resolved block
kdb set system/examples/blockresolver/section1/key12 val12

cat /tmp/test.block
#> text
#> more text
#> some more text
#> >>> block config start
#> [section1]
#> key1 = val1
#> key12 = val12
#> [section2]
#> key2 = val2
#> >>> block config stop
#> text again
#> and more text
#> text

# cleanup
kdb rm -r system/examples/blockresolver
sudo kdb umount system/examples/blockresolver
```
