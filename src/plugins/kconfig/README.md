## Introduction

This plugin can be used to parse a [KConfig](https://cgit.kde.org/kconfig.git) INI file into a KeySet, and also write a KeySet to a file in 
such a format.

Information about the syntax:

- Files are expected to be encoded in `UTF-8`.
- Empty lines are ignored.
- Lines that start with a `#` character are considered comments. Comments are ignored too.
- Configurations consist of groups and keys. Only keys can have values.
- Key names can't start with a `[` character
- Keys can contain spaces and any special characters except `=`.
- If a key has a value, then it will be followed with an `=` symbol and then the value will be read until the end of the line.
  The white space characters around the `=` symbol are ignored.
- In values, the following escape sequences can be used:
  - `\n` and `\r` are mapped to newline
  - `\t` is mapped to tab
  - `\\` is mapped to `\`
- Values can contain any character from the `UTF-8` set except for newline and `\` followed by an invalid escape sequence.
- Keys can be localized. The locale is surrounded with `[` and `]` and cannot start with `$`.
- Same key names can be used multiple times if it has different locales. The following example is valid:
  ```
  greeting[en] = Hello
  greeting[de] = Hallo
  ```
- Keys can have metadata. Those are one byte long, start with `$` and are surrounded with `[` and `]`.
- The same key name can't be used multiple times with different metadata (different to locales). The following example is invalid:
  ```
  key.name[$a] = Something
  key.name[$i] = Something else
  ```
- Group names begin have a `[` symbol at the beginning of a line and every key that follows them is part of this group (until the next
  group is declared)

An example of how a valid config file might look like:

```
[group][subgroup]
key.name[en][$i][$e]=Key Value
key.name[de]=Key Wert
```

And how it will be represented in kdb:

```
keyNew (PREFIX "group/subgroup/key.name[en]", KEY_VALUE, "Key Value", KEY_META, "kconfig", "ie", KEY_END)
keyNew (PREFIX "group/subgroup/key.name[de]", KEY_VALUE, "Key Wert", KEY_END)
```

## Usage

The following example shows you how you can read data using this plugin.

```sh
# Mount the plugin to the cascading namespace `/tests/kconfig`
sudo kdb mount configrc /tests/kconfig kconfig

# Manually add a key-value pair to the database
echo 'key=Value' > `kdb file /tests/kconfig`

# Retrieve the new value
kdb get /tests/kconfig/key
#> Value

# Set the value to Example
kdb set /tests/kconfig/key Example
#> Set string to "Example"

# Verify that the value has changed in the file too
cat `kdb file /tests/kconfig`
#> key=Example

# Manually add a gorup to the database
echo '[group][subgroup]' >> `kdb file /tests/kconfig`

# Manually add a key that contains metas to that group
echo 'key.name[$a][$i]=New Value' >> `kdb file /tests/kconfig`

# Retrieve the new value
kdb get /tests/kconfig/group/subgroup/key.name
#> New Value

# Retrieve the meta values
kdb meta-get /tests/kconfig/group/subgroup/key.name kconfig
#> ai

# Undo modifications to the database
sudo kdb umount /tests/kconfig
```

## Limitations

- Comments from the file are discarded on save (same as the default KConfig functionality)
- No validation for meta values or locale codes
