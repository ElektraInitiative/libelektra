/******************************************************************************
 * Extensive documentation for Nickel is maintained on the Bohr Game Libraries
 * website: http://www.chaoslizard.org/devel/bohr/wiki/Docs/Ni
 *
 * I'll give a brief overview here anyway, for those who're too lazy to look at
 * the real documentation.  But really, check out the website for details.
 *
 * Nickel, at heart, stores nodes, each of which has a name, value, and any
 * number of children.  Children are stored in a hash table for quick lookup.
 * Built around this is a set of functions for building such a map from a
 * standard Windows .ini file, as well as writing back to a file format that, if
 * the map is carefully constructed or read from a .ini file, is roughly
 * compatible with the Windows GetPrivateProfile* functions.
 *
 * The only hard-coded size limit in Nickel is the length of node names, which
 * are capped at elektraNi_KEY_SIZE-1 (127, currently) bytes (not UTF-8 characters) to
 * give a reasonable maximum boundary on search time.  Otherwise, you're limited
 * only by available memory.  Thus, Nickel can parse files as big as the C
 * standard library can handle, and node values can be as big as will fit in
 * memory.  The number of children a node can have, as well as the size of the
 * entire tree, is also limited only by available memory.
 *
 * There is some wasted memory with each node--it allocates a number (32,
 * currently) of initial spaces (each sizeof(void *)) in the hash table of the
 * node's children, so resizing (an expensive operation) occurs less frequently.
 * Also, it doubles the capacity of the hash table when it gets 3/4 full, so
 * searching has a good average-case running time, but this means there's always
 * some wasted space.
 *
 * Following are the details of the files that Nickel can parse and write.
 *
 * Files should be UTF-8 (or plain ol' ASCII) encoded, though Nickel can handle
 * arbitrary binary data too.
 *
 * On reading, Nickel treats all newline flavors (at least, CR, LF, and CRLF) as
 * simply LF (\n in C).  This applies EVEN INSIDE QUOTED STRINGS (see below).
 * If you need a CR (\r in C) character in a node's name/value, you must escape
 * it (see below), that is, put a literal "\r" (backslash, lower r).
 *
 * Though this is not enforced, the first few characters of a Nickel-compatible
 * (as per version 1 of the API) .ini file should be:
 *
 *    ;Ni1
 *
 * (that's semicolon, upper N, lower i, digit 1) followed by a newline.  This
 * gives a machine-parsable sequence that future Nickel versions or other
 * parsers can use to identify the file format, while being a .ini comment (see
 * below) and thus ignored by anything that shouldn't care.  Though it's not
 * currently checked in Nickel (it'll try to parse anything you throw at it), it
 * may be in future versions.
 *
 * There are two kinds of data Nickel looks for in .ini files: names and values.
 * A name is a sequence of characters inside a number of [] (square brackets),
 * which denotes a section heading, OR before an = (equals sign), which denotes
 * that the value for the node follows.  Either way a name is encountered, a
 * node with that name will be created (or, if the named node already exists,
 * its value or children will be modified, depending on what comes next).
 *
 * Both names and values can have surrounding "" (double quotes).  When the
 * parser encounters an opening " (double quote), it parses all data until a
 * closing " (double quote), even spanning newlines, in the context of the name
 * or value.  The parser supports string concatenation whereby:
 *
 *    "some"  "thing"
 *
 * is equivalent to:
 *
 *    "something"
 *
 * Whitespace must be the only characters between closing " (double quote) and
 * re-opening " (double quote) for this to work (or, in values, there can be a
 * \ (backslash) and a newline--see escaping, below).
 *
 * Comments are initiated with the ; (semicolon).  Any ; (semicolon) outside of
 * double quotes begins a comment (except when escaped, see below).  Comments go
 * until the end of the line (and cannot be continued onto the next line with \
 * (backslash), as in some languages).
 *
 * Any line deemed invalid (e.g. blank or without an = (equals sign) or []
 * (square brackets)) is ignored as a comment.
 *
 * Nickel understands escape sequences similar to those in C.  Nickel translates
 * these escape sequences regardless of whether it's inside quotes or not.  It
 * treats the following sequences the same as C:
 *
 *    \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \' \" \? \\ \ooo and \xhh
 *
 * where ooo is up to 3 octal digits (0-7), hh is up to 2 hex digits (0-9, a-f,
 * or A-F), and all other characters are literally as they're written there.
 * The behavior of the hex escape (\xhh) may differ from how C handles it in
 * that I believe C allows the string of hex digits to be longer than 2.  And
 * I'm not sure how C handles octal constants bigger than 255, but Nickel takes
 * the whole octal value and uses the result modulus 256.  But that's just
 * semantics.
 *
 * Nickel also understands the following escape sequences, which exist only to
 * allow .ini reserved characters in names and values in the file:
 *
 *    \; \[ \] \=
 *
 * These are simply replaced with the character following the backslash.
 *
 * Note that escape sequences aren't always necessary, but are always parsed if
 * present.  Thus the following two lines are equivalent:
 *
 *    poo = \ \="\[    ; here, the = and [ are escaped
 *    poo = "\\ =\"["  ; here, double quotes are used and \ and " are escaped
 *
 * and indicate the node has a value of: \ (backslash), space, = (equals sign),
 * " (double quote), and [ (opening square bracket).  In the example, the double
 * quotes aren't necessary on the second line, but are there to illustrate that
 * the escape sequences are the same inside and outside of quotes (except that
 * in quotes, if a " (double quote) is encountered unescaped, it obviously ends
 * the quote).
 *
 * In values only, it is possible to escape a literal newline to instruct Nickel
 * to continue consuming the next line as part of the value.  This escape
 * consists of a \ (backslash) as the last non-whitespace character on a line,
 * ignoring comments.  If following a quoted string, the \ (backslash) should
 * come after the closing " (quote).  If the string immediately before the \
 * (backslash) is quoted, the \ (backslash)-newline pair is simply omitted, but
 * if the previous string was unquoted, the pair is replaced by a single space,
 * regardless of how much intervening space there actually was.  Thus, the
 * following lines all create equivalent nodes:
 *
 *    poo = abc def   ; just the string "abc def"
 *    poo = abc    \  ; no quotes, lots of spaces, and continue on the next line
 *          "def"     ; quotes here just for shits and giggles--not necessary
 *    poo = "abc " \  ; first line with quotes, then continue on the next line
 *          def       ; which could also have quotes ("def"), doesn't matter
 *
 * with the 7-character value "abc def".
 *
 * Surrounding names and values, whitespace is eaten by the parser.  This
 * happens after comments are removed (see the above example).  If you really
 * want a node whose name or value begins or ends with spaces, enclose it in
 * quotes.  Inside names and values, whitespace is maintained.  The exception to
 * this is with the line-continuation escape, where, if the string immediately
 * preceding the \ (backslash) was unquoted, spaces trailing on the top line or
 * beginning the second line are all replaced with a single space, or if the
 * preceding string was quoted, no space is inserted and initial space on the
 * following line is ignored.  See the above example for clarification on this.
 *
 * Lines giving values to named nodes (e.g. name = value) become children of the
 * node given in the most recent previous section (e.g. [name]), or the root
 * node if there have been no sections yet.  You can define subsections (e.g.
 * [[name]]) by specifying increasing numbers of [ (opening square bracket)
 * characters.  Sections with the same number of brackets become children of the
 * most recently preceding parent defined with fewer brackets; sections with
 * more brackets become deeper children, and sections with fewer brackets are
 * closer to the root.  The following example shows the root gaining two
 * children, "child1" (with value "teh suz" and child "sub_child1") and "child2"
 * (with its own child "sub_child2"):
 *
 *    child1 = teh suz  ; create child1 as a child of the root, give it a value
 *    [  child2  ]      ; another root child, anything below is child2's child
 *     [[sub_child2 ]]  ; sub_child2, having more [, is under child2
 *    [child1]          ; back up to root's child child1
 *     sub_child1=      ; this is a child of the previous section, i.e., child1
 *
 * (Spaces were added and the order was slightly obfuscated to show these things
 * are unimportant.)  Note that the parser ignores the number of ] (closing
 * square brackets) for the sake of keeping insignificant typos from causing
 * errors, but to stay compatible with future versions of Nickel or other
 * parsers, you should close each section with the same number of ] (closing
 * square brackets) as it was opened with.
 *
 * Also note that if you skip steps in your subsections, e.g.:
 *
 *    [child1]
 *     [[[ sub_sub_child1 ]]]
 *
 * empty children are inserted to make up the difference (here, "child1" has an
 * unnamed child, which has a child "sub_sub_child1").
 *
 * If a name is given more than once under the same parent in a file, the last
 * instance overrides all previous instances.  Thus:
 *
 *    [child1]
 *     sub = asdf
 *    [child1]
 *     sub = again
 *
 * gives "child1" a child called "sub", and gives it the value "again".  Note
 * that there is only one "child1", and the value "asdf" is overwritten by
 * "again" for "sub".
 *
 * It's valid to specify empty names.  Here:
 *
 *    []
 *    =
 *
 * creates a node with an empty name as the child of the root, and gives it a
 * child with an empty name and empty value.
 *
 * One more note: the parser is pretty lax--it will glean as much valid
 * information from a line as it can, ignoring errors if it can still get
 * something useful.  This can lead to weird results.  Consider the following
 * lines:
 *
 *    [section]  child = value
 *    # comments = cool!
 *
 * Here, because anything other than a comment after the ] (closing square
 * bracket) is invalid, the parser ignores "child = value" on the first line.
 * Also, because # (hash mark) isn't the standard for initiating a comment, the
 * second line creates a child of "section" named "# comments", with the value
 * "cool!".  Keep your files valid and standard and you won't have issues.
 *
 * This gives you an idea how the parser works.  More examples are in order for
 * future revisions of this document, but as I imagine this'll mostly be used
 * for simple .ini parsing, what's above is sufficient for now.
 *
 * While Nickel should be able to parse any Windows-compatible .ini file, it
 * won't necessarily output to a format that Windows will understand.  Some
 * circumstances it will generate an incompatible file are:
 *
 *   * The tree is more than one level deep
 *   * A node's name or value contains a special character: [ = \ ; etc. (as
 *     these may be escaped by Nickel)
 *   * A node's name or value has initial or trailing whitespace (as Nickel will
 *     put such a string inside quotes)
 *
 * Nickel can always parse a file it generates; it's just that Windows doesn't
 * understand some of Nickel's syntax, I believe, like nested headings, escaped
 * characters, and quotes.  Also, if you read a Windows-compatible .ini file
 * into memory and write it right back out to disk, you'll get a Windows-
 * compatible .ini file as long as no special characters are in any node's
 * value.  Nickel is fairly good about escaping special characters only when
 * necessary (as of v1.1.0, anyway), but if maximum compatibility with other
 * parsers is your goal, avoid special characters in names and values.
 *
 * It's also worth noting that since Nickel builds an in-memory map based on the
 * .ini file, and writing files uses the in-memory representation of the data,
 * comments in the file are entirely lost.  This is unfortunate, but means that
 * Nickel runs quickly enough to be used inside, say, a game, since accessing
 * the data doesn't require costly disk reads.
 *
 * It's also unfortunate that order is lost between reading and writing.  This
 * is due to hashing mixing things up.  The speed gain from hashing entries
 * greatly outweighs maintaining order, in my mind, and keeping an index of the
 * order nodes were added would take more overhead than I believe it's worth.
 *
 * Thus concludes my lengthy explanation of Nickel's .ini parser.
