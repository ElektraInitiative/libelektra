## Introduction

The Lineendings Plugin verifies the line endings of a file.
If inconsistent line endings or line endings that don't match `valid` are detected the plugin yields an error.

## Configuration

`valid`
The key tells the plugin to reject all line endings other than specified in this key. Valid options: CRLF, LFCR, CR, LF
If the key doesn't exist only inconsistent line endings are rejected.
