   TITLE:       Include file of package for work with stacks of
		objects (OS)

   DESCRIPTION: The package `objstack' implements efficient work
       with stacks of objects (OS).  Work with the object on the stack
       top is analogous to one with a variable length object.  One
       motivation for the package is the problem of growing char
       strings in symbol tables.  Memory for OS is allocated by
       segments.  A segment may contain more one objects.  The most
       recently allocated segment contains object on the top of OS.
       If there is not sufficient free memory for the top object than
       new segment is created and the top object is transferred into
       the new segment, i.e. there is not any memory reallocation.
       Therefore the top object may change its address.  But other
       objects never change address.

   SPECIAL CONSIDERATION:
	 Defining macro `NDEBUG' (e.g. by option `-D' in C/C++
       compiler command line) before the package macros usage disables
       to fix some internal errors and errors of usage of the package.
	 A file using the package can be compiled with option
       `-DOS_DEFAULT_SEGMENT_LENGTH=...'.
	 C: Because arguments of all macros which return a result
       (`OS_TOP_LENGTH', `OS_TOP_BEGIN', and `OS_TOP_END') may be
       evaluated many times no side-effects should be in the
       arguments.
