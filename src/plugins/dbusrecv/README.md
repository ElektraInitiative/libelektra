## Introduction

This plugin is a notification plugin, which receives a signal from D-Bus when
the key database (KDB) has been modified.
It is compatible with the sending D-Bus plugin.

## Dependencies

- `libdbus-1-dev`

## Usage

The recommended way is to globally mount the plugin together with the dbus plugin:

```sh
kdb global-mount dbus dbusrecv
```

This plugin is designed to be used as a transport plugin for Elektra's
notification feature.
If notification is not enabled (i.e. in the tool `kdb` or in any other
application that does not use `elektraNotificationOpen()`) this plugin performs
no actions.

This plugin cannot be directly used to receive notifications.
Applications that use the notification feature implicitly use it when this
plugin is mounted globally.

# Transport Plugin

Mount this plugin globally with default settings to use it as _receiving_
transport plugin for Elektra's notification feature:

> kdb global-mount dbusrecv

For the message format please see
[the `dbus` plugin documentation](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/dbus#notification-format).
