## Introduction

This is a plugin reading and writing JSON files
using the library [yail](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/)

The plugin was tested with yajl version 1.0.8-1 from Debian 6
and yajl version 2.0.4-2 from Debian 7.

Examples of files which are used for testing can be found
below the folder in "src/plugins/yajl/examples".

The JSON grammar can be found [here](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt).

A validator can be found [here](http://jsonlint.com/).

Supports every KeySet except when arrays are intermixed with other keys.
Has only limited support for metadata.

## Dependencies

- `libyajl-dev` (version 1 and 2 should work)

## Types

My metadata `type` the used types can be chosen:

- `string`:
  The JSON string type.
- `boolean`:
  The JSON boolean type (true or false)
- `double`:
  For JSON numbers.

If no metadata `type` is given, the type is either:

- `null` on binary null-key
- `string` otherwise

Any other type/value will still be treated as string, but
the warning `#78` will be added because of the potential
data loss.

## Special values

In JSON it is possible to have empty arrays and objects.
In Elektra this is mapped using the special names

    ###empty_array

and

    ___empty_map

Arrays are mapped to Elektraâ€™s array convention #0, #1,..

## Restrictions

- Only UTF-8 is supported. Use the `iconv` plugin if your locale are
  not UTF-8. When using non-UTF-8 the plugin will be able to write
  the file, but cannot parse it back again. You will error #77,
  invalid bytes in UTF8 string.
- Everything is string if not tagged by metakey "type"
  Only valid JSON types can be used in type, otherwise there are some
  fall backs to string but warnings are produced.
- Values in non-leaves are discarded.
- Arrays will be normalized (to #0, #1, ..)
- Comments of various JSON-dialects are discarded.

Because of these potential problems a type checker,
comments filter and directory value filter are highly recommended.

## OpenICC Device Config

This plugin was specifically designed and tested for the
`OpenICC_device_config_DB` although it is of course not limited
to it.

Mount the plugin:

    kdb mount --resolver=resolver_fm_xhp_x color/settings/openicc-devices.json /org/freedesktop/openicc yajl rename cut=org/freedesktop/openicc

or:

    kdb mount-openicc

Then you can copy the OpenICC_device_config_DB.json
to systemwide or user config, e.g.

    cp src/plugins/yajl/examples/OpenICC_device_config_DB.json /etc/xdg
    cp src/plugins/yajl/examples/OpenICC_device_config_DB.json ~/.config

    kdb ls system/org/freedesktop/openicc

prints out then all device entries available in the config

    kdb get system/org/freedesktop/openicc/device/camera/0/EXIF_manufacturer

prints out "Glasshuette" with the example config in source

You can export the whole system openicc config to ini with:

    kdb export system/org/freedesktop/openicc simpleini > dump.ini

or import it:

    kdb import system/org/freedesktop/openicc ini < dump.ini
