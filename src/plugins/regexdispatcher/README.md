## Introduction

A plugin which generates regex representations of specification keywords for the 
typechecker plugin before saving a configuration specification. For instance the
regex for the metakey `check/enum/#` depends on the metakey's values, as the two
definitions `check/enum/#1=A` and `check/enum/#2=B` would result in the regex
`A|B` stored in the `elektra/spec/regex/check/enum` metakey that can be treated
by the typechecker as a regex directly.

## Usage

In order to generate regex representations for different specification keywords, mount a configuration specification along with this plugin. 

`kdb mount <specification> spec/<path> <storage plugin to read the specification> regexdispatcher typechecker`
