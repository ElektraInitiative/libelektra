# Benchmarks

## `benchmark_storage`

The following table shows a summary of the results of a `benchmark_storage` run:
NOTE: `factor` is always `dump / quickdump` (bigger = `quickdump` is faster), this test was only run with version 1, see below for a comparison of with version 2

| operation        | dump (µs) | quickdump (µs) | factor |
| ---------------- | --------: | -------------: | -----: |
| write keyset     |     81661 |           4741 | 17.224 |
| read keyset      |     94782 |          44673 |  2.122 |
| iterate keyset   |       125 |            135 |  0.926 |
| delete keyset    |      1823 |           3518 |  0.518 |
| re-read keyset   |     92939 |          43749 |  2.124 |

## `benchmark_plugingetset`

A script was used to generate KeySets with `2`, `200`, `2,000`, `200,000` and `2,000,000` Keys. For keynames we used
increasing numbers (prefixed with `_` to keep correct order), each key had a randomized value of 15 characters.
Additionally we added 4 metakeys to each key. The names and values of these were created similarly.

The parent key used was `dir/tests/bench`.

We then used [`hyperfine`](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) to compare the performance of `dump` and `quickdump`.

```
hyperfine --min-runs 25 'benchmark_plugingetset <path> <parent> dump' 'benchmark_plugingetset <path> <parent> quickdump'
```

This means we used the same key sets for each of the runs, but the key values shouldn't really matter. It also means
that no shared metadata (`keyCopyMeta`) was involved.

We also used a modified version of `benchmark_plugingetset` that returned after the `get` call, to test the `get`
performance by itself. Because `set` doesn't scale linearly because of the checks for `keyCopyMeta`, the largest
KeySet was only used for the `get` only version. (The test was aborted after the initial run of `dump` took longer than
all the runs for `quickdump` together.)

The complete results can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/rawdata)
and the files used for these benchmarks are quite big and can be found in another
[separate repository](https://github.com/kodebach/eqd-bench).

### Raw data sizes

For reference in the file size tests below, here is a list of the raw data sizes of the keysets. These sizes are calculated as the
sum of: 1) length of all keynames 2) length of all key values 3) length of all metakeys 4) length of all meta values
All lengths include a null terminator, sizes are calculated once with (WP) and once without the parent key (WOP).
