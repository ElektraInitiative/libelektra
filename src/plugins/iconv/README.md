## Introduction ##

This plugin is a filter plugin that converts between different character encodings.

## Purpose ##

Consider a user insisting on a `latin1` character encoding because of some old application. All other users already use, for example, `UTF-8`. For these users, the conﬁguration ﬁles are encoded in `UTF-8`. So we need a solution for the user with `latin1` to access the key database with proper encoding. 

On the other hand, contemplate an XML ﬁle which requires a speciﬁc encoding. But the other key databases work well with the users encoding. So a quick ﬁx for that backend is needed to feed that XML ﬁle with a different encoding. 

Iconv plugin provides a solution for both scenarios. It converts between many available character encodings. With the plugin’s conﬁguration the user can change the from and to encoding. 	
The default values of the plugin conﬁguration are:	
`from` encoding will be determined at run time.	
`to` encoding is `UTF-8`.

Note that for writing the conﬁguration `from` and `to` is swapped. A key database that requires a speciﬁc encoding can make use of it. To sum up, every user can select a different encoding, but the key databases are still properly encoded for anyone.
