## Introduction

This plugin is a storage plugin allowing Elektra to read and write XML
formatted files. It uses a general format which:

- Maps key names to XML elements
- Maps key values to textual content of XML elements
- Maps metakeys to XML attributes. Metakey name = attribute name, Metakey value
  = attribute value
- Ignores XML comments

## Usage

To mount an XML file we use:

```bash
kdb mount file.xml user/test/file xerces
```

The strength and usage of this plugin is that it supports arbitrary XML files and
does not require a specific format. Given the following example of an XML file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no" ?>
<xerces>foo
  <bar meta="da_ta">bar</bar>
</xerces>
```

Please note that if the key name does not correspond to the root element of the xml
file, the original name gets stored in a metakey called `xerces/rootname`. The content
of the root element gets mapped to the mount point.

We can observe the following result after mounting:

```bash
kdb get user/test/file
#> foo
kdb get user/test/file/bar
#> bar
kdb meta-get user/test/file/bar meta
#> da_ta
```

To export an existing keyset to the XML format:

```bash
kdb export user/test/xerces xerces > example.xml
```

The root element of the resulting XML file will be "xerces" again, restored via the
metadata. If you don't want this behavior, delete the metadata `xerces/rootname` on
the mount point, then it uses the mount point's name instead.

## Dependencies

- `Xerces-C++ 3.0.0` or newer (`apt-get install libxerces-c-dev` or `brew install xerces-c` on macOS)
- CMake 3.6 or a copy of `FindXercesC.cmake` in
  `/usr/share/cmake-3.0/Modules/`

To include this plugin in a homebrew installation run `brew tap elektrainitiative/elektra` followed by `brew install elektrainitiative/elektra/elektra --with-xerces`

## Limitations

This plugin is not able to handle key names which contain characters that are not
allowed to appear as an XML element name. Consider using the rename plugin to
take care about proper escaping.

The main rules of an XML element name are:

- Element names must start with a letter or underscore
- Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc.)
- Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods
- Element names cannot contain spaces

The root key is not allowed to be an array, as this would correspond to multiple
root elements in XML (see the
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/1451)).

XSD transformations, schemas or DTDs are not supported yet.

## Examples

### Mounting, setting a key and exporting

```sh
# Backup-and-Restore:user/tests/xercesfile

sudo kdb mount xerces.xml user/tests/xercesfile xerces

kdb set user/tests/xercesfile foo
kdb meta-set user/tests/xercesfile xerces/rootname xerces
kdb set user/tests/xercesfile/bar bar
kdb meta-set user/tests/xercesfile/bar meta "da_ta"

kdb meta-get user/tests/xercesfile xerces/rootname
#> xerces

kdb get user/tests/xercesfile/bar
#> bar

kdb export user/tests/xercesfile xerces
# STDOUT-REGEX: <bar meta="da_ta">bar</bar>

sudo kdb rm -r user/tests/xercesfile
sudo kdb umount user/tests/xercesfile
```
