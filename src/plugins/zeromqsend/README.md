## Introduction

This plugin is a notification plugin, which sends notifications using ZeroMq
publish (`ZMQ_PUB`) sockets when the key database (KDB) has been modified.
It is compatible with the sending zeromqrecv plugin.

## Dependencies

- `libzmq3-dev` (ZeroMQ C bindings > 3.2)

## Usage

The recommended way is to globally mount the plugin together with the zeromqrecv plugin:

> kdb global-mount zeromqsend zeromqrecv

This plugin is designed to be used as a transport plugin for Elektra's
notification feature.
Since ZeroMq creates threads for asynchronous I/O this plugin always operates
asynchronously.

Since ZeroMQ sockets only provide a 1:n mapping (i.e. one publisher with many
subscribers or one subscriber and many publishers) the `zeromqsend` and
`zeromqrecv` plugins require a XPUB/XSUB endpoint.
The kdb tool ["hub-zeromq"](https://www.libelektra.org/tools/hub-zeromq)
provides these endpoints.

# Transport Plugin

Mount this plugin globally with default settings to use it as *sending*
transport plugin for Elektra's notification feature:

> kdb global-mount zeromqsend

# Configuration

This plugin supports the following configuration options when mounting:

- **endpoint**: ZeroMQ XSUB or SUB socket to connect to. The
[`ipc`](http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-ipc) and
[`tcp`](http://api.zeromq.org/4-2:zmq-tcp) ZeroMQ transports are recommended.
The default value is "tcp://localhost:6000".
- **connectTimeout**: Timeout for establishing connections in milliseconds. The default value is "1000".
- **subscribeTimeout**: Timeout for waiting for subscribers in milliseconds. The default value is "200".

# Notification Format

The ZeroMQ transport plugins use the publish/subscribe sockets (`ZMQ_PUB` and
`ZMQ_SUB`) for notification transport.

Each notification is a multipart message. The first part contains the type of
change, the second part contains the name of the changed key.

Possible only current change is `Commit`.
