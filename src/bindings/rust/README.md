# Rust Bindings

Rust bindings for libelektra.

## Usage

### Raw Bindings

Safe wrappers are provided in the `elektra` crate, however you can also use the raw bindings from `elektra_sys` directly. Rust for instance does not allow the definition of variadic functions, but allows calling them. So you can call `keyNew` as you would in C.

```rust
use elektra_sys::{keyNew, keyDel, keyString, KEY_VALUE, KEY_END};

fn main() {
    let key_name = CString::new("user/test/key").unwrap();
    let key_val = CString::new("rust-bindings").unwrap();
    let key = unsafe { keyNew(key_name.as_ptr(), KEY_VALUE, key_val.as_ptr(), KEY_END) };
    let ret_val_str = unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(keyString(key)) };
    assert_eq!(ret_val_str, key_val.as_c_str());
    assert_eq!(unsafe { keyDel(key) }, 0);
}
```

## Generation

Bindings are generated when buildling the `elektra-sys` crate using `rust-bindgen`. The `build.rs` script in the `elektra-sys` crate calls and configures bindgen. It also emits additional configuration for `rustc` to tell it what library to link against, and where to find it.
Bindgen expects a `wrapper.h` file that includes all headers that bindings should be generated for. Since these headers could have additional includes, the `build.rs` also passes the elektra source and binary directory to clang, such that these includes can be found.
Finally, bindgen outputs the bindings into a file, that is then included in the `elektra-sys/lib.rs` file, where it can be used from other crates.

## Troubleshooting

Rust-bindgen needs clang to generate the bindings, so if you encounter the following error, make sure clang (3.9 or higher) is installed.

```
/usr/include/limits.h:123:16: fatal error: 'limits.h' file not found
/usr/include/limits.h:123:16: fatal error: 'limits.h' file not found, err: true
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unable to generate bindings: ()', src/libcore/result.rs:999:5
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
