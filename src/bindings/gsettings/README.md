# elektrasettings

**Warning !!!** This binding is unstable and could destroy your Elektra Configuration. Only use in testing environments.

Implementation of Elektra as GSettingsBackend

## What is Working:

- passing gsettings unit tests
- all interface functionality but one
  - reading user and (system) default values
  - writing user values and trees of user values
  - reset (delete) a key
  - synchronization (no conflict handling yet)
  - subscribing and unsubscribing for changes (needs Elektraâ€™s [dbus plugin](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/plugins/dbus) mounted on subscribed path)
  - get writability of key (As far as definable as writable from Elektra)

## What is Not

- synchronization conflict handling
- code cleanup
- proper error handling
- optimizations
- get permission (Elektra does not support this)
- Setting write path in Elektra

## Pending Issues

- See #762, #302, #775, #768

## Going to Change

- default write path in elektra (currently this is /sw), this will probably going to be
  either a setting in kdb or an environment variable.

# Building

## Dependencies

- elektra (for standalone build)
- gelektra (for standalone build)
- glib
- gio
- dbus

## Build

### As Part of Elektra Build

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GSETTINGS_MODULE_PRIORITY=200 -DBINDINGS=gsettings ..
make
```

### Standalone Build

```sh
cd GSETTINGS_SOURCE
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GSETTINGS_MODULE_PRIORITY=200 ..
make
```

- `GSETTINGS_MODULE_PRIORITY` set this value above the value of other GSettingsBackend modules so it gets selected as default
- the dconf GSettingsBackend is known to have a value of `100`

# Installation

```sh
(sudo) make install
```

If you do a system installation consider doing a migration, so you can immediately keep using your settings.

# Migration

## Import dconf User Settings

For now you can export your existing dconf database trough:

```sh
dconf dump > dconf.ini
```

and import it in elektra

```sh
cat dconf.ini | kdb import /sw ini
```

## Mount dbus Plugin

export current settings and delete them so they will not be hidden

```sh
kdb export /sw dump > tmp
kdb rm -r /sw
```

mount sw at you preferred location

```sh
(sudo) kdb mount sw /sw dbus $restofplugins
```

import settings again

```sh
(sudo) cat tmp | kdb import /sw dump
rm tmp
```

If you want notifications to work you have to mount /sw with the dbus plugin.

# Debugging

`G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=ElektraSettings` will enable debug output of the backend. If you have
set the priority of the module below `100` and dconf installed you also have to
set `GSETTINGS_BACKEND=elektra` to be able to test elektra as default backend.

##Examples

### Get/Set and Reset a Gsettings Value

```sh
export G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=ElektraSettings
export GSETTINGS_BACKEND=elektra
gsettings get org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor auto-indent
gsettings set org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor auto-indent false
gsettings get org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor auto-indent
gsettings reset org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor auto-indent
gsettings get org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor auto-indent
gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.gedit.preferences.editor auto-indent
```

### Force Elektra as Default Backend When Starting an Application:

```sh
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=ElektraSettings GSETTINGS_BACKEND=elektra gedit
```

an application can still request a different backend then elektra with `g_settings_new_with_backend ()`
