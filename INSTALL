Where to Find Elektra
=====================

Elektra stable source code as tarballs and source-RPMs can be found at:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117521

Elektra Subversion repository with unstable source code can be checked
out with these commands and requires at least automake 1.7 and autoconf 2.59:

  bash:~$ cd src
  bash:~/src$ svn co http://germane-software.com/repositories/elektra/trunk elektra
  bash:~/src$ cd elektra
  bash:~/src/elektra$ # files are here



Building and Installation
=========================

You should always prefer building Elektra from its source RPM as:

	$ rpmbuild --rebuild elektra-VERSION.src.rpm

or:

	$ rpmbuild -ta elektra-VERSION.tar.gz


The default RPM specifications that come with the source were written to
meet the Filesystem Hierarchy Standards.
Packaging methodology used are similar to those of Fedora, Red Hat and CentOS.

A Mandriva spec file can be found inside the source code, and also (old
unmaintained) Debian packaging scripts and info.

More building info can be found in the elektra.spec.in RPM
construction file.


General Building and Installation Instructions
==============================================

If you can't afford that, you should use the distributed tarball.

If you still want to use the old tarball, this is the correct
way to do it, following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard:

	$ ./configure \
		--bindir=/bin \
		--libdir=/lib \
		--sysconfdir=/etc \
		--disable-xmltest \
		--mandir=/usr/share/man \
		--with-docdir=/usr/share/doc/elektra \
		--with-develdocdir=/usr/share/doc/elektra-devel \
		--with-docbook=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets

Try with these options too:
		--prefix=/usr \
		--exec-prefix=/ \


	$ make all
	# make install

You can also call the last as:

	# make DESTDIR=/some/directory install

The "--with-docbook" switch should point to Norman Walsh's DocBook XSL
stylesheets on your system. Some common places:

/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/ (Debian)
/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets (Red Hat, the default)


For any further information, check the RPM spec file elektra.spec.in.


Building RPMs from the Subversion Repository
============================================

Do not use the fresh files from the Subversion repository, since they might
be quite unstable. Doing this requires at least automake 1.7 and autoconf 2.59.
If you know what you are doing, do this:

  bash:~$ cd src
  bash:~/src$ svn co http://germane-software.com/repositories/elektra/trunk elektra
  bash:~/src$ cd elektra
  bash:~/src/elektra$ ./bootstrap.sh
  bash:~/src/elektra$ ./configure \
		--bindir=/bin \
		--libdir=/lib \
		--sysconfdir=/etc \
		--mandir=/usr/share/man \
		--with-docdir=/usr/share/doc/elektra \
		--with-develdocdir=/usr/share/doc/elektra-devel \
		--disable-xmltest \
		--with-docbook=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets

  bash:~/src/elektra$ make dist
  bash:~/src/elektra$ rpmbuild -ta elektra-VERSION.tar.gz

Then RPMs will appear under your RPM building tree.
Try also to do this right after ./configure:

  bash:~/src/elektra$ make rpm

RPMs will be generated under ~/src/elektra/rpmdir

   /usr/share/man/man3/ks*.3.gz        (Manpages for the ks*() methods)




Still TODO
==========

	- Include documentation in package
	- Build documentation with xsltproc
	  and Doxygen (These tools are currently
	  checked for existance in the configure script).
	- Install includes file in include (include/elektra ?)

Should be nice to have different configure script
for backends. This will allow to check specific
dependency on each backends. Moreover, perhaps
could be cool to externalize backends and have
one package for each ?

Libltdl for (hope) cross-platform is bundled with
libelektra and so, add no dependency.

Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.)

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX', the package will
use PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

will cause the specified gcc to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.
