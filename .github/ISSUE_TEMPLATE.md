kdb set user:/tests/hello world
#> Create a new key user:/tests/hello with string "world"

kdb get user:/tests/hello
#> world

kdb get user:/tests/hello/does/not/exist
# RET: 11
# STDERR: .*[Dd]id not find key 'user:/tests/hello/does/not/exist'

kdb rm user:/tests/hello

If your key database (KDB) might influence the outcome, please use `kdb stash` to temporarily have an empty KDB.
