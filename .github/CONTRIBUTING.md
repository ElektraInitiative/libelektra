# Documentation #

We use a fork and pull model, you can read about
[forking repos at github help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Any typo fixes, spelling fixes, fixes in documentation,
or README.md can be done without any further considerations!
Simply do the fixes in your cloned repo and create a pull request.

[github issue](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/new).
