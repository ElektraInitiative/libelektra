- shortDesc: New Website, puppet-libelektra, New Plugins

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

## Highlights

This is by far the largest release in Elektra's history.
In 2813 commits, 19 authors changed 1714 files with 92462
insertions(+) and 21532 deletions(-). The highlights are:

- libelektra.org: new website and puppet-libelektra
- plugin+bindings for Haskell and Ruby
- improved shell completion
- new plugins: yamlcpp, camel, mini, date, file, range,
  multifile, xerces, ipaddr

### libelektra.org

Unfortunately this release was delayed. The reason for the delay is that our
community server ([build server](https://build.libelektra.org), web site,...)
was compromised and we needed to reinstall everything from scratch.

We took advantage of the situation, and reinstalled everything properly
managed by [puppet-libelektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/puppet-libelektra).
With puppet-libelektra, you can directly set keys, specifications (validations),
and even mount new configuration files from within Puppet.

Our community server is now completely managed by libelektra.

Thanks to Bernhard Denner, for rescuing us from the difficult situation, especially
for the sprint shortly before the release.

As already already announced in [December 2016](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/news/2016-12-17_website_release.md)
we completely reimplemented our website. Now all our websites are available via https.
This release is the first one that includes the source code of the website and its
snippet sharing functionality.

The backend for this snippet sharing website uses Elektra itself: both for its
configuration and for the configuration snippets.

Thanks again to Marvin Mall for the awesome website.

#### Haskell and Ruby

The Ruby binding, created by Bernhard Denner, was greatly improved and now
includes libtools bindings. It is the first binding that goes beyond Elektra's
main API. Bernhard Denner also added many
[examples](https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/swig/ruby/examples) that
demonstrate how you can take advantage of the Ruby bindings.

Armin Wurzinger created a new binding
for the functional language Haskell. He also added support for
Haskell plugins.
Due to generic CMake and C Code, plugins can be written
exclusively in Haskell, without any glue code. Several Haskell
examples already exist. The Haskell support is currently experimental.

### Shell Completion

René Schwaiger added completion support for [Fish](http://fishshell.com)
in this release. We also extended our support for other shells: The new
tool `kdb complete` suggests how to complete an Elektra path. It considers
mountpoints and also takes bookmarks into account. Thanks to Armin
Wurzinger for creating this useful utility. Our Zsh and fish completions
already take advantage of `kdb complete`. Thanks to Sebastian Bachmann
for taking the time to update the `zsh` completions.

### New Plugins

See [plugin overview](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/)
to get an overview of the ever-growing number of plugins.

The [yamlcpp plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yamlcpp)
and camel plugin
add first support for YAML.

The [mini plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mini)
is yet another minimal INI plugin.

Thanks to René Schwaiger.

The [date plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/date)
supports validation of dates according to three standards:

- `RFC2822`
- `ISO8601`
- `POSIX`

The [multifile plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/multifile)
allows us to integrate many configuration files via globbing with
a single mount command. It supports `.d` configuration directories
as often used today.

The [file plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/file)
interprets the content of a file as configuration value.

The [ipaddr plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/ipaddr)
adds support for IP address validation on systems that do not
support `getaddrinfo`.

Thanks to Thomas Waser for creating these useful plugins.

The [xerces plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xerces)
supplants the [xmltool plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xmltool)
and allows us to use XML files not following a specific schemata.
Attributes are mapped to Elektra's metadata, multiple keys with the
same names are mapped to arrays.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.

## Documentation

The documentation was greatly improved within this release.

- Added "Hello, Elektra" and logging tutorial,
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- extended [FAQ](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/elektra-faq.md)
- Christoph Weber (@krit0n) improved some tutorials
- options are passed to PDFLaTeX compiler,
  thanks to René Schwaiger

- fix many spelling mistakes, use American english, fix formatting,
  fix+add links, unify title style, fix code blocks, add titles
  and fix the PDF manual
  a big thanks to René Schwaiger

## Features

We added even more functionality, which could not make it to the highlights:

- DBUS support for qt-gui (listening to configuration changes):
  qt-gui gets a viewer-mode where configuration settings are immediately updated
  via DBus notifications, thanks to Raffael Pancheri
  With the new qt-gui and newer qt releases (~5.7) the qtquick experience is much smoother,
  for example, the tree view does not collapse on syncs anymore.
- Armin Wurzinger greatly improved the [JNA binding](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/jna).
  The build system now uses Maven to build them. Armin also added Doxygen documentation
  and a [script](http://master.libelektra.org/scripts/randoop/randoop.in)
  to test the JNA binding using [Randoop](https://randoop.github.io/randoop).
- The improved [curlget plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/curlget),
  is now able to upload configuration files,
  thanks to Thomas Waser and Peter Nirschl (CMake fixes).
- New command `kdb rmmeta`, thanks to Bernhard Denner
- [crypto plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/crypto) and [fcrypt plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/fcrypt)
  - The configuration option `gpg/key` was renamed to `encrypt/key`
  - The plugins now make sure that you configured them properly by
    validating key IDs
  - thanks to Peter Nirschl
- [fcrypt plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/fcrypt):
  - The plugin now list available GPG keys when config is missing
  - You can now specify signatures via the configuration option `sign/key`
  - New text mode, enabled by default (disable by setting `fcrypt/textmode` to `0`)
  - New option `fcrypt/tmpdir` allows you to specify the output directory of `gpg`
  - If you want to learn how to use the plugin please check out our new [ASCII cast](https://asciinema.org/a/153014)
  - thanks to Peter Nirschl
- Thomas Waser added useful scripts:
  - [mount-list-all-files](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mount-list-all-files.md)
    to list all mounted files.
  - [mountpoint-info](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mountpoint-info.md)
    to provide more info about mountpoints.
  - [stash](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-stash.md)
    to stash away Elektra's configuration, to be restored using `restore`.
  - [backup](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-backup.md)
    to backup Elektra's configuration.
  - [restore](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-restore.md)
    to restore a backup or stash.
  - [check-env-dep](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-check-env-dep.md)
    allows users to check if environment has influence on configuration settings.
  - [change-resolver-symlink](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-change-resolver-symlink.md)
    allows users to change the default resolver.
  - [change-storage-symlink](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-change-storage-symlink.md)
    allows users to change the default storage.
- limit min/max depth for `kdb ls` (`-mM`), thanks to Armin Wurzinger.
- conditionals: allow multiple assigns and conditions
- base64 also works as filter for binary data (not just encrypted data),
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- [csvstorage plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/csvstorage):
  compatibility with RFC 4180, thanks to Thomas Waser
- [gitresolver plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/gitresolver):
  improvements and update of libgit version, thanks to Thomas Waser
- [curlget plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/curlget):
  also allow uploading of configuration files, thanks to Thomas Waser

## Compatibility

As always, the ABI and API of kdb.h is fully compatible, i.e. programs
compiled against an older 0.8 version of Elektra will continue to work
(ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

We added `explicit` to some C++ constructors in libtools and internally moved
some typedefs. ModulesPluginDatabase now has protected members (instead
of private). This might break code in special cases, but should not affect binary
compatibility. As always we tested for binary compatibility.
This time we had to revert some changes to keep libelektra-tools
ABI compatible.

Furthermore:

- scripts now work on macOS (readlink and sed),
  thanks to Armin Wurzinger and René Schwaiger
- generalized error #60, "invalid line encountered"
- added new errors #164 - #187
- added private headerfiles `kdbglobal.h`, `kdbinvoke.h`

## Notes for Package Maintainer

These notes are of interest for people maintaining packages of Elektra:

- LICENSE.md now contains only the BSD 3-Clause License
  (without any additional non-license text)
- AUTHORS renamed to AUTHORS.md
- NEWS.md is now a generated file containing all news concatenated
- CMake 2.8.8 is no longer supported, CMake 3.0 is now needed
- fix macOS `RPATH`, remove old policies, thanks to René Schwaiger
- new option `BUILD_DOCSET` to build DocSet, thanks to René Schwaiger
- new option `ENABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` for `OPMPHM` preparation work,
  thanks to Kurt Micheli
  For this release, please keep `ENABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` turned off.
  Currently the flag increases memory usage, without being faster.
- add `TARGET_TOOL_DATA_FOLDER` for installation of tool data

The following files are new:

- Libs: `libelektra-utility.so` ,`libelektra4j-0.8.20.pom.xml`,
  `libelektra-invoke` (needed by plugins: curlget, gitresolver, dini, blockresolver, multifile)
- Plugins: `libelektra-camel.so`, `libelektra-date.so`,
  `libelektra-file.so`, `libelektra-ipaddr.so`, `libelektra-mini.so`,
  `libelektra-multifile.so`, `libelektra-range.so`, `libelektra-xerces.so`,
  `libelektra-yamlcpp.so`
- Tools: `backup`, `mount-list-all-files`, `mountpoint-info`, `restore`,
  `stash`, `update-snippet-repository`
- Tests: `change-resolver-symlink`, `change-storage-symlink`,
  `check-env-dep`, `check_bashisms`, `check_doc`, `check_meta`,
  `testmod_camel`, `testmod_crypto_openssl`, `testmod_date`,
  `testmod_file`, `testmod_ipaddr`, `testmod_jni`, `testmod_mini`,
  `testmod_range`, `testmod_simpleini`, `testmod_xerces`, `testmod_yamlcpp`,
  `testtool_plugindatabase`, `test_utility`

The following files were removed: `testmod_curlget`, `testmod_dpkg`,
`testmod_profile`, `testmod_shell`, `testmod_spec`, `test_opmphm_vheap`,
`test_opmphm_vstack`

The following files were renamed:
`libelektra-1.jar` → `libelektra4j-0.8.19.jar`

In the Debian branch of the [git repo](https://git.libelektra.org/tree/debian),
we now build upon the work of Pino Toscano. The branch allows building
Debian packages of the release for Debian Stretch and Jessie.

Thanks to Pino Toscano for the high-quality packages.

- A reimplementation of Elektra's core API in Rust
  (next to implementation in C).
- A user interface which generates restricted input fields
  based on the specification.
- YAML as configuration file format (next to INI, XML, JSON, TCL, ...).
- An mmap persistent cache.
- Improvements for the specification language.
- New APIs to be directly used by applications.
- An order-preserving minimal hash for O(1) lookup and iteration.
- Mainloop migration for notifications (currently only DBus,
  to be extended to Redis, ZeroMq).
- Improvements on the Website and snippet sharing to also
  handle misconfiguration.
