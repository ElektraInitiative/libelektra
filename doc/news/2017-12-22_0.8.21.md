### CC-licenced Book About Vision of Elektra Published

I am proud to release a book with the title "Context-aware Configuration" describing:

- the last 13 years of Elektra (focus on last 4 years with the questionnaire survey and code analysis),
- the current state of Elektra, and
- the long-term goals of Elektra (context-aware configuration).

The Fosdem talk will cover some highlights from the book.

A huge thanks to everyone involved in the questionnaire survey,
without you we would not have been able to collect all the
information that led to the requirements for Elektra.

The LaTeX sources are available [here](https://book.libelektra.org)
and the compiled book can be downloaded from [here](https://www.libelektra.org/ftp/elektra/publications/raab2017context.pdf).

### Maturing of Plugins

- The new [Directory Value plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/directoryvalue) supports storage plugins such as [YAJL](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yajl) and [YAML CPP ](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yamlcpp). It adds extra leaf values for directories (keys with children) that store the data of their parents. This way plugins that normally are only able to store values in leaf keys are able to support arbitrary key sets.
- The [YAML CPP plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yamlcpp) reads and writes [YAML](http://yaml.org) data using [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp). The plugin supports arrays, binary data and metadata.
- The [Camel plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/camel) stores data as simplified YAML flow lists containing double quoted keys and values. For proper YAML support please use the [YAML CPP](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yamlcpp) instead.
- The [mINI plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mini) reads and writes simple property list, separated by equal (`=`) signs.
- The [xerces plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xerces) allows Elektra to read and write XML data. The plugin uses [Xerces-C++](http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c) for this task. It supports both arrays and metadata.
- The [boolean plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/boolean) normalizes boolean values such as `0`, `1`, `true` and `false`.
- The [crypto plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/crypto) and [fcrypt plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/fcrypt) are described below.

### Elektra With Encryption

The plugins `fcrypt` and `crypto` are now considered stable. They are no longer tagged as `experimental`.
While `crypto` encrypts individual values within configuration files, `fcrypt` encrypts and/or signs the whole configuration file.

For this release Peter Nirschl prepared a demo showing Elektra's cryptographic abilities:

Thanks to Peter Nirschl for this great work!

### Switch to INI

We plan to switch to INI as default storage instead of Elektra's infamous internal dump format.

As preparation work we implemented the `dini` plugin which transparently
converts all `dump` files to `ini` files on any write attempt.
Furthermore, we fixed most of the INI bugs which blocked INI to be the
default storage.

Due to this progress we will likely switch to INI as default starting
with the next release. If you want to, you can switch now by compiling
Elektra with:<br>
`-DKDB_DEFAULT_STORAGE=dini`

Or simply switch for your installation with:<br>
`sudo kdb change-default-storage dini`

If you are already using `ini` as default, changing to `dini` will:

- add some overhead because `dini` always checks if a file uses the `dump`
  format, unless the `dump` plugin is not installed.
- add support for binary values using the `binary` plugin

> NOTE: INI (dini) was not completely ready for 0.8.21 thus we kept `dump` as default.
> `dini` is currently an experimental plugin.

## Other New Features

We added even more functionality, which could not make it to the highlights:

- `kdb rm` now supports `-f` to ignore non-existing keys
- use `%` as profile name to disable reading from any profile
- The new function `elektraArrayDecName`:

  ```c
  int elektraArrayDecName (Key * key);
  ```

  decreases the index of an array element by one. It can be used to reverse the effect of `elektraArrayIncName`,
  thanks to René Schwaiger

## Documentation

We improved the documentation in the following ways:

- We renamed our beginner friendly issues to "good first issue" as recommended by GitHub.
- In many parts of the documentation we already switched to American spelling
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- Added more [automatic spelling corrections](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/sed)
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- Fixed many spelling mistakes
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- We extended the ReadMe of the `jni` plugin. The ReadMe now also contains information about the Java prerequisites of the `jni` plugin on Debian Stretch.
- Improved notes about testing
  thanks to Thomas Wahringer
- qt-gui: give hints which package to install
- The build phrases `jenkins build all please` and `jenkins build doc please` were [documented](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/GIT.md)
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- Documentation for libelektra-invoke was added

## Compatibility

As always, the ABI and API of kdb.h is fully compatible, i.e. programs
compiled against an older 0.8 version of Elektra will continue to work
(ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

All unit tests of 0.8.20 run successfully with Elektra 0.8.21.
There are, however, some additions and changes in rarely used interfaces:

- added `elektraArrayDecName` and `elektraArrayValidateName` in libease
- fixed `kdbinvoke.h` interface: make structure private and complete API
- fixed `xmlns` and `xsi:schemaLocation` to be `https://www.libelektra.org`
- the private header file `kdbopmphm.h` got nearly rewritten

## Notes for Maintainer

These notes are of interest for people maintaining packages of Elektra:

- We added the following files in this release:
  - `libelektra-dini.so`
  - `libelektra-directoryvalue.so`
  - `testmod_directoryvalue`
- The following plugins are not marked as experimental anymore:
  - `camel`
  - `crypto`
  - `mini`
  - `xerces`
  - `yamlcpp`
- The binding `intercept-fs` is now marked more clearly as experimental
- The `jni` plugin is again experimental because it does not work with some Java systems.
  For the `lua` plugin there are also problems with some Lua systems.

## Notes for Elektra's Developers

These notes are of interest for people developing Elektra:

- From now on release notes are written as part of PRs
- Elektra Initiative is spelled as two words
- At some more places we switched to use the logger, thanks to René Schwaiger
- Shell Recorder got many improvements, see below in Testing.
  Please use it.
- The plugin's template now adds all placements within backends by default
  (must be removed accordingly).
- We now warn if plugins do not have any placement.
- Please prefer -log and -debug builds
- The build server now understands the build phrase `jenkins build all please`
  thanks to René Schwaiger.
  Please use it carefully, since it puts our [build server](https://build.libelektra.org/) under heavy load.
- Markdown Shell Recorder Syntax recommended when reporting bugs.
- Elektra's [Dockerfile](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/docker/legacy/Dockerfile) was improved and simplified, thanks to Thomas Wahringer.
- Add more Explanations how to do Fuzz Testing
- Started documenting disabled tests in [doc/todo/TESTING](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/todo/TESTING)
- You now can use `tests/icheck.suppression` to disable already checked API changes.
- The (hopefully) last Sourceforge references were removed and a redirection page was added,
  thanks to @the-Arioch for reporting.

## Testing

- AFL unveiled some crashes in INI code
- fix OCLint problems, thanks to René Schwaiger
- fix ASAN problems, thanks to René Schwaiger
- disabled non-working tests
- Shell recorder
- Benchmark optionally also works with OpenMP, thanks to Kurt Micheli
- The Shell Recorder now uses `kdb-static` or `kdb-full` if `kdb` is not available (`BUILD_SHARED=OFF`)

## Fixes

Many problems were resolved with the following fixes:

- fix use of `dbus_connection_unref(NULL)` API
  thanks to Kai-Uwe Behrmann
- Properly include headers for `std::bind`
  thanks to Nick Sarnie
- qt-gui: assure active focus on appearance selection window
  thanks to Raffael Pancheri
- René Schwaiger repaired the `boolean` plugin:
  - wrong metadata was used
  - plugin configuration was missing
  - documentation was missing
  - logging code was added
- René Schwaiger repaired many problems different build agents had
- `kdb info -l` does not open `KDB` anymore.
- `change-resolver-symlink` and `change-storage-symlink` now correctly use
  `@TARGET_PLUGIN_FOLDER@`
- date plugin will be removed on attempts to compile it with gcc 4.7, thanks to René Schwaiger
- C plugin: storage/c metadata added
- fix disabling documentation in CMake, thanks to Kurt Micheli
- Simplify `elektraArrayValidateName`, thanks to René Schwaiger

## Outlook

The Order Preserving Minimal Perfect Hash Map (OPMPHM) is ready to extend `ksLookup`. The implementation of the randomized Las Vegas hash map
algorithm is in a final stage and the heuristic functions that ensure time and space optimality are backed up by benchmarks.
Thanks to Kurt Micheli, the next release will include the OPMPHM!
