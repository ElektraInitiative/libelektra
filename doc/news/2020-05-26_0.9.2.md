- shortDesc: KDE and GNOME Integration, `elektrad` in Go

We are proud to release Elektra 0.9.2.

With the 0.9.x series of releases we shift our focus to bugfixes and stability improvements as needed for the KDE and GNOME integration.
We do not guarantee any compatibility in this series.

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

You can also read the news [on our website](https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.2-release)

## Highlights

- KDE integration
- GNOME Integration
- `elektrad` rewritten in Go

### KDE Integration

We created a [fork](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/kconfig) of [KDE's](https://kde.org/) `KConfig` configuration system and patched it to use libelektra. We have done some initial testing and replaced the `KConfig` library for [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) and [KDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org/) successfully.

Additionally, we added a new Elektra plugin called `kconfig`, which can read and write kconfig's INI files.
The plugin enables smooth migration of existing KDE configurations. _(Dardan Haxhimustafa)_ and _(Felix Resch)_

### GNOME Integration

We continued work on Elektra's bindings for [GNOME GSettings](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/2.26/GSettingsBackend.html). Our implementation should be able to replace the widely used [dconf](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/dconf) backend. Elektra's `gsettings` bindings are not yet ready for production use, but they are already able to replace `dconf` for a complete GNOME session without problems. We are still lacking proper dbus integration for change notifications. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### `elektrad` rewritten in Go

[elektrad](https://www.libelektra.org/tools/elektrad) provides an HTTP API to access Elektra remotely. `elektrad` is now completely rewritten in Go, which drastically improves the performance by leveraging the new [go-elektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/go-elektra/) bindings instead of calling the `kdb` command-line tool on every request. The new `elektrad` creates a session per user to reuse the same [KDB handle](https://doc.libelektra.org/api/latest/html/group__kdb.html) for correct conflict handling and better performance. _(Raphael Gruber)_

## Try out Elektra

You can try out the latest Elektra release using our docker image [elektra/elektra](https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra). This is the quickest way to get started with Elektra without compiling and other obstacles.

Get started with Elektra by running `docker run -it elektra/elektra`.

## Plugins

We removed the `maintained` status of the following [plugins](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme):

- blockresolver
- csvstorage
- gitresolver
- list
- multifile
- spec

New maintainers are very much welcomed!

### Augeas

- Improved error message for Augeas to show lensPath. _(Michael Zronek)_

### CCode

- The [Markdown Shell Recorder][] test of the plugin does not require Bash any more. _(René Schwaiger)_

[markdown shell recorder]: https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper

### Crypto

- The crypto plugin no longer supports Botan and OpenSSL as provider of cryptographic functions. The support has been removed to improve the maintainability of the code. _(Peter Nirschl)_
- The unit test of the crypto plugin attempts to kill the gpg-agent if a regular shutdown via `connect-gpg-agent` failed. _(Peter Nirschl)_

### Directory Value

- The plugin now only interprets a [KeySet](https://doc.libelektra.org/api/latest/html/group__keyset.html) as [array](../tutorials/arrays.md) if the parent contains the metakey `array`. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Fcrypt

- Improve handling of temporary files after encryption and decryption by trying to perform a manual copy if the call of `rename` fails. This problem might occur if another file system is mounted at `/tmp`. _(Peter Nirschl)_

### KConfig

- Write support for the KConfig INI format was added. _(Dardan Haxhimustafa)_

### SWIG

- Configure line (-DBINDINGS="..") for SWIG based bindings have been changed from `swig_foo` to `foo`. _(Manuel Mausz)_
- Exclude SWIG bindings if SWIG Version is 4.0.1 and Python is >= 3.8 or Ruby is >= 2.7 due to incompatibility (#3378, #3379). _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### SWIG/python

- Added bindings for libelektratools. _(Manuel Mausz)_
- Add test for kdbEnsure. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### SWIG/python2

- Removed python2 binding, as python2 support ended. _(Manuel Mausz)_

### Tcl

- The [Markdown Shell Recorder][] test of the plugin now correctly requires the [`xmltool` plugin](../../src/plugins/xmltool). _(René Schwaiger)_

### YAMBi

- We removed the plugin in favor of Yan LR. _(René Schwaiger)_

### YAML CPP

- The plugin now always prints a newline at the end of the YAML output. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The plugin does not interpret a key set such as

  ```
  user/example
  user/example/#0
  user/example/#1
  user/example/#2
  ```

  as array unless the parent key `user/example` contains the metakey `array`. _(René Schwaiger)_

- YAML CPP now always sets and requires the metakey `type` with the value `boolean` for boolean data. _(René Schwaiger)_

- We limited the scope of a logging function of the module. This makes it possible to build Elektra again, if
  - you enabled the logger (`ENABLE_LOGGER=ON`),
  - build the “full” (`BUILD_FULL=ON`) version of Elektra, and
  - include both the Directory Value and YAML CPP plugin in your build configuration. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Yan LR

- The CMake code of the plugin does not print error messages produced by the tool `ldd` any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The plugin now also supports ANTLR 4.8. _(René Schwaiger)_
- We limited the scope of the logging code of the module. For more information, please take a look at the last news entry of the YAML CPP plugin. _(René Schwaiger)_

### GOpts

- The plugin now supports an offset into `argv` given by the `/offset` config key. If `/offset` is set, `gopts` will
  ignore a number of arguments at the start of `argv`. This can be used in e.g. python scripts to ignore the interpreter
  arguments. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `gopts` now also writes help message into the key `proc/elektra/gopts/help/message` in addition to setting
  `proc/elektra/gopts/help = 1`. This is especially useful in non-C/C++ environments. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `gopts` is also affected by the changes and improvements to the `opts` library outlined below.

### Cache

- Respect `XDG_CACHE_HOME` when resolving the mmap cache directory. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.

### Compatibility

- We clarified compatibility requirements for Elektra and its plugins and bindings.
  Furthermore, we renamed `system/elektra/version/constants/KDB_VERSION_MICRO`
  to `system/elektra/version/constants/KDB_VERSION_PATCH` to be compatible
  with [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). _(Markus Raab)_

### Opts

- The library function `elektraGetOpts` now supports sub-commands.
  Sub-commands are best explained by looking at an application that uses them, like `git`.
  For example `add` is a sub-command in `git add`, and interprets `-p` differently from `git`:
  `git -p add` is `git --paginate add`, but `git add -p` is `git add --patch`.
  `elektraGetOpts` now implements this notion of sub-commands.
  For more information take a look at the [tutorial for command-line-options](../tutorials/command-line-options.md).
  By extension this functionality is also available via the `gopts` plugin. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The generated help message was improved. It now also gives details about parameter arguments, sub-commands and
  environment variables in addition to the existing support for option arguments. This also means that it is no longer
  possible to have multiple keys with the `args=remaining` metadata (because their `opt/help` may not be the same).
  _(Klemens Böswirth)_

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up-to-date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

### python2

- Removed python2 plugin, as python2 support ended. _(Manuel Mausz)_

### Rust

- Published `elektra` and `elektra-sys` to crates.io. _(Philipp Gackstatter)_

## Tools

- Update `kdb cache` tool synopsis to reflect man page. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Pull elektrad, webui and webd out of shared web folder to allow fine grained selection of tools. _(Raphael Gruber)_
- [webd](../../src/tools/webd/README.md) has updated dependencies. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

## Scripts

- The [fish completion script](../../scripts/completion/kdb.fish) now recognizes the new names of subcommands (e.g. `meta-set` instead of `setmeta` ) introduced with Elektra `0.9.1`. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The script [reformat-cmake](../../scripts/dev/reformat-cmake) now reformats the code with `cmake-format` 0.6.3. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The scripts

  - [reformat-c](../../scripts/dev/reformat-cmake), and
  - [reformat-java](../../scripts/dev/reformat-java)

  now uses `clang-format` 9 to reformat the code base. _(René Schwaiger)_

- The script [reformat-shell](../../scripts/dev/reformat-shell) now makes sure that you do not use `shfmt` 3, which formats parts of the code base slightly differently. _(René Schwaiger)_

## Documentation

- Improved formatting of the [`validation tutorial`](../../doc/tutorials/validation.md) _(Anton Hößl)_
- We fixed some minor spelling mistakes. _(René Schwaiger)_
- We updated the man pages of the [`web`](../tutorials/install-webui.md) tool. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Updated documentation for Ubuntu-Bionic Packages. _(Djordje Bulatovic)_
- Fixed an old path of the reformatting script in the [`docker reformatting tutorial`](../tutorials/run_reformatting_script_with_docker.md) _(Jakob Fischer)_

## Tests

- We now use [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) version `1.10` to test Elektra. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The C++ test code does not produce warnings about a missing macro argument for `...` any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Whitelisted many broken links. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Enabled regex in link checker. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- The [formatting check](../../tests/shell/check_formatting.sh) now also works correctly, if it is invoked multiple times. _(René Schwaiger)_
- `KDB_EXEC_PATH` is not being set globally to contain the build directory any longer. _(Peter Nirschl)_
- Rewrite gpg-agent shutdown logic to use `fork` and `execv` instead of `system`. _(Peter Nirschl)_
- Removed a broken link from the link checker. _(Djordje Bulatovic)_

## Build

### Compilation

- We do not use implicit typing in the code of the

  - `augeas`,
  - `base64`, and
  - `blockresolver`

  plugin any more. After this update, the code compiles without any warnings, even though we now use the compiler switch `-Wconversion`. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Support

- Debian 9 “stretch” (oldstable) is now the oldest supported platform. _(René Schwaiger)_

### CMake

- Generating the build system now requires CMake `3.4` (released in November 2015). _(René Schwaiger)_
- We fixed warnings about CMake policy [CMP0078](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0078.html) and [CMP0086](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0086.html). _(René Schwaiger)_
- The CMake functions `add_msr_test` and `add_msr_test_plugin` do not export the list of required plugins as environment variable any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The CMake code of the code generation does not print warnings about unknown regex operators any more. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Docker

- We updated some of the software in the [Dockerfile for Debian sid](../../scripts/docker/debian/sid/Dockerfile). _(René Schwaiger)_
- Building the documentation Dockerfile for Debian Stretch works again. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Use Python 3, SWIG 4.0 and Ruby 2.5 in the [Dockerfile for Debian sid](../../scripts/docker/debian/sid/Dockerfile). _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Disable python binding on `debian-unstable-full-clang` due to upstream [issue](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/3379). _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Use current ruby-dev on Debian sid image as Ruby 2.5 has been dropped. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
