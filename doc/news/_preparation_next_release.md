### <<HIGHLIGHT2>>

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [modules](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

### Augeas

- Improved error message for augeas to show lensPath. _(Michael Zronek)_

### CCode

- The [Markdown Shell Recorder][] test of the plugin does not require Bash any more. _(René Schwaiger)_

[markdown shell recorder]: https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper

### Crypto

- The crypto plugin no longer supports Botan and OpenSSL as provider of cryptographic functions. The support has been removed to improve the maintainability of the code. _(Peter Nirschl)_
- The unit test of the crypto plugin attempts to kill the gpg-agent if a regular shutdown via `connect-gpg-agent` should fail for any reason during the clean-up phase. _(Peter Nirschl)_

### Directory Value

- The plugin now only interprets a key set as [array](../tutorials/arrays.md) if the parent contains the meta key `array`. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Fcrypt

- Improve handling of temporary files after encryption and decryption by trying to perform a manual copy if the call of `rename` fails. This problem might occur if another file system is mounted at `/tmp`. _(Peter Nirschl)_

### KConfig

- We implemented the methods that save a KeySet into a file with the KConfig Ini format. _(Dardan Haxhimustafa)_

### SWIG

- Configure line (-DBINDINGS="..") for SWIG based bindings have been changed from `swig_foo` to `foo`. _(Manuel Mausz)_
- Exclude SWIG bindings if SWIG Version is 4.0.1 and Python is >= 3.8 or Ruby is >= 2.7 due to incompatibility (#3378, #3379). _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### SWIG/python

- Added bindings for libelektratools. _(Manuel Mausz)_
- Add test for kdbEnsure. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### SWIG/python2

- Removed. _(Manuel Mausz)_

### Tcl

- The [Markdown Shell Recorder][] test of the plugin now correctly requires the [`xmltool` plugin](../../src/plugins/xmltool). _(René Schwaiger)_

### YAMBi

- We removed the plugin in favor of [Yan LR](../../src/plugins/yanlr). _(René Schwaiger)_

### YAML CPP

- The plugin now always prints a newline at the end of the YAML output. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The plugin does not interpret a key set such as

  ```
  user/example
  user/example/#0
  user/example/#1
  user/example/#2
  ```

  as array unless the parent key `user/example` contains the meta key `array`. _(René Schwaiger)_

- YAML CPP now always sets and requires the metakey `type` with the value `boolean` for boolean data. _(René Schwaiger)_

- We limited the scope of a logging function of the module. This makes it possible to build Elektra again, if
  - you enabled the logger (`ENABLE_LOGGER=ON`),
  - build the “full” (`BUILD_FULL=ON`) version of Elektra, and
  - include both the Directory Value and YAML CPP plugin in your build configuration. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Yan LR

- The CMake code of the plugin does not print error messages produced by the tool `ldd` any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The plugin now also supports ANTLR 4.8. _(René Schwaiger)_
- We limited the scope of the logging code of the module. For more information, please take a look at the last news entry of the YAML CPP plugin. _(René Schwaiger)_

### GOpts

- The plugin now supports an offset into `argv` given by the `/offset` config key. When `/offset` is set, `gopts` will
  ignore a number of arguments at the start of `argv`. This can be used in e.g. python scripts to ignore the interpreter
  arguments. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `gopts` now also writes help message into the key `proc/elektra/gopts/help/message` in addition to setting
  `proc/elektra/gopts/help = 1`. This is also useful in non-C/C++ environments. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `gopts` is also affected by the changes and improvements to the `opts` library outlined below.

### Cache

- Respect `XDG_CACHE_HOME` when resolving the mmap cache directory. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.

### Compatibility

- We clarified compatibility requirements for Elektra and its plugins and bindings.
  Furthermore, we renamed `system/elektra/version/constants/KDB_VERSION_MICRO`
  to `system/elektra/version/constants/KDB_VERSION_PATCH` to be compatible
  with [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). _(Markus Raab)_

### Core

- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

### Opts

- The library function `elektraGetOpts` now supports sub-commands.
  Sub-commands are best explained by looking at an application that uses them, like `git`.
  For example `add` is a sub-command in `git add`, and interprets `-p` differently from `git`:
  `git -p add` is `git --paginate add`, but `git add -p` is `git add --patch`.
  `elektraGetOpts` now implements this notion of sub-commands.
  For more information take a look at the [tutorial for command-line-options](../tutorials/command-line-options.md).
  By extension this functionality is also available via the `gopts` plugin. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The generated help message was improved. It now also gives details about parameter arguments, sub-commands and
  environment variables in addition to the existing support for option arguments. This also means that it is no longer
  possible to have multiple keys with the `args=remaining` metadata (because their `opt/help` may not be the same).

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up to date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

### python2

- Removed. _(Manuel Mausz)_

### Rust

- Published `elektra` and `elektra-sys` versions `0.9.1` to crates.io. _(Philipp Gackstatter)_

## Tools

- [elektrad](../../src/tools/elektrad/README.md) is completely rewritten in Go - which drastically improves the performance by leveraging the new [go-elektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/go-elektra/) bindings instead of calling the `kdb` command-line tool on every request. _(Raphael Gruber)_
- Update `kdb cache` tool synopsis to reflect man page. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Pull elektrad, webui and webd out of shared web folder to allow fine grained selection of tools. _(Raphael Gruber)_
- <<TODO>>

## Scripts

- The [fish completion script](../../scripts/completion/kdb.fish) now recognizes the new names of subcommands (e.g. `meta-set` instead of `setmeta` ) introduced with Elektra `0.9.1`. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The script [reformat-cmake](../../scripts/dev/reformat-cmake) now reformats the code with `cmake-format` 0.6.3. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The script [reformat-shell](../../scripts/dev/reformat-shell) now makes sure that you do not use `shfmt` 3, which formats parts of the code base slightly differently. _(René Schwaiger)_

## Documentation

- improved formatting of the [`validation tutorial`](../../doc/tutorials/validation.md) _(Anton Hößl)_
- We fixed some minor spelling mistakes. _(René Schwaiger)_
- We updated the man pages of the [`web`](../tutorials/install-webui.md) tool. _(René Schwaiger)_

## Tests

- We now use [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) `1.10` to test Elektra. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The C++ test code does not produce warnings about a missing macro argument for `...` any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Whitelisted many broken links. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Enabled regex in link checker. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- The [formatting check](../../tests/shell/check_formatting.sh) now also works correctly, if it is invoked multiple times. _(René Schwaiger)_
- `KDB_EXEC_PATH` is not being set globally to contain the build directory any longer. _(Peter Nirschl)_

## Build

### Compilation

- We do not use implicit typing in the code of the

  - `augeas`,
  - `base64`, and
  - `blockresolver`

  plugin any more. After this update, the code compiles without any warnings, even though we now use the compiler switch `-Wconversion`. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Support

- Debian 9 “stretch” (oldstable) is now the oldest supported platform. _(René Schwaiger)_

### CMake

- We fixed warnings about CMake policy [CMP0078](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0078.html) and [CMP0086](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0086.html). _(René Schwaiger)_
- The CMake functions `add_msr_test` and `add_msr_test_plugin` do not export the list of required plugins as environment variable any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- The CMake code of the code generation does not print warnings about unknown regex operators any more. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Generating the build system now requires CMake `3.4` (released in November 2015). _(René Schwaiger)_

### Docker

- We updated some of the software in the [Dockerfile for Debian sid](../../scripts/docker/debian/sid/Dockerfile). _(René Schwaiger)_
- Building the [documentation Dockerfile for Debian Stretch](../../scripts/docker/debian/stretch/doc.Dockerfile) works again. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Use python 3, SWIG 4.0 and ruby 2.5 in the [Dockerfile for Debian sid](../../scripts/docker/debian/sid/Dockerfile). _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Disable python binding on `debian-unstable-full-clang` due to upstream [issue](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/3379). _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- <<TODO>>
