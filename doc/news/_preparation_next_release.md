We are proud to release Elektra 0.8.<<VERSION>>.

<<`scripts/git-release-stats 0.8.<<VERSION>>`>>

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

## Highlights

- Added a new, binary and fast storage plugin called [`mmapstorage`](https://libelektra.org/plugins/mmapstorage).
  It leverages the `mmap()` syscall and supports full Elektra semantics.
  We provide two compile variants: `mmapstorage` and `mmapstorage_crc`.
  The `mmapstorage_crc` variant enables CRC32 checksums for critical data,
  while the `mmapstorage` variant omits the checksum for maximum performance.

  We ran a synthetic benchmark with 127 iterations using 40k keys in a keyset,
  and compared the performance to the `dump` storage plugin.

  Median write time in microseconds:

  | Plugin | Time |
  | --- | --- |
  | `dump` | 63794 |
  | `mmapstorage` | 4325 |
  | `mmapstorage_crc` | 9072 |

  Median read time in microseconds:

  | Plugin | Time |
  | --- | --- |
  | `dump` | 76419 |
  | `mmapstorage` | 1115 |
  | `mmapstorage_crc` | 5338 |

  In our benchmark, the `mmapstorage` plugin writes more than 14x faster,
  and reads more than 68x faster than the `dump` storage plugin. *(Mihael Pranjić)*


- Hybrid Search Algorithm for `ksLookup (...)`

- <<HIGHLIGHT2>>
- <<HIGHLIGHT3>>


### Hybrid Search Algorithm for `ksLookup (...)`

The hybrid search algorithm is now implemented, this concludes the extension of the `ksLookup (...)` search with the
[order preserving minimal perfect hash map (OPMPHM)](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/dev/data-structures.md#order-preserving-minimal-perfect-hash-map-aka-opmphm).
The hybrid search combines the best properties of the binary search and the [OPMPHM](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/dev/data-structures.md#order-preserving-minimal-perfect-hash-map-aka-opmphm).
The hybrid search decides dynamically which search algorithm to use, the API user can overrule the hybrid search by passing
`KDB_O_OPMPHM` or `KDB_O_OPMPHM` to the `ksLookup (...)`. The constants are defined in [kdbproposal.h](https://master.libelektra.org/src/include/kdbproposal.h).*(Kurt Micheli)*

#### Results

The implemented randomized [OPMPHM](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/dev/data-structures.md#order-preserving-minimal-perfect-hash-map-aka-opmphm)
algorithm is in 99.5% of the measured random cases optimal. However the randomization property of the algorithm leaves an uncertainty.

The results made with random cases had shown that the hybrid search is except for small keyset sizes almost always faster
compared to the standalone binary search. The performance increase strongly depended on the measured hardware. In the random cases
where the hybrid search is faster, on average ~8.53% to ~20.92% of time was saved.
The implemented hybrid search works only above a keyset size of `599` to exclude the small keyset sizes.

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [modules](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

### Process

-  There is also a new plugin called [process](https://libelektra.org/plugins/process).
   This plugin utilizes the pluginprocess library in order to execute arbitrary other
   plugins in an own process, acting as a proxy itself. Therefore it is not required
   to explicitly change a plugin's implementation if it shall be executed in an own
   process. This plugin is not completely finished yet, as currently there is no way
   for it to mimic the proxied plugin's contract in Elektra. It can be used with simple
   plugins like `dump` however, check the limitations in the readme for more details. *(Armin Wurzinger)*

### gpgme

- The `gpgme` plugin was brought into existence to provide cryptographic functions using GnuGP via the `libgpgme` library. See [#896] *(Peter Nirschl)*

### network

The `network` plugin now also allows for non-numerical hosts (i.e. "localhost") to be set and tries to
resolve it via DNS. *(Michael Zronek)*

### YAMBi

This new plugin parses a subset of YAML using a parser generated by [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison). *(René Schwaiger)*

### Yan LR

- The plugin does not modify the (original) parent key any more. As a consequence, setting values at the root of a mountpoint:

  ```sh
  sudo kdb mount config.yaml user/tests/yambi yambi
  kdb set user/tests/yanlr 'Mount Point Value'
  kdb get user/tests/yanlr
  #> Mount Point Value
  ```

  now works correctly. *(René Schwaiger)*

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.


### Compatibility

As always, the ABI and API of kdb.h is fully compatible, i.e. programs
compiled against an older 0.8 version of Elektra will continue to work
(ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

## Tools

- Added benchmarks for storage plugins. The currently benchmarked plugins are `dump` and `mmapstorage`.  *(Mihael Pranjić)*
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>


## Scripts

- We now require [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) 6.0 for formatting C and C++ code. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The command [`reformat-source`](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/reformat-source) now displays information about the installed
  version of `clang-format`, if it is unable to locate a supported version of the tool. *(René Schwaiger)*
- <<TODO>>


## Documentation

- We fixed some minor spelling mistakes in the documentation. *(René Schwaiger)*
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- Go into more detail in
    [BUILDSERVER.md](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/BUILDSERVER.md).
    *(Lukas Winkler)*


## Tests

- The unit test for the [`dbus` plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/dbus) does not leak memory anymore, if it fails on macOS.
  *(Thomas Wahringer)*
- The tests `testkdb_allplugins` and `testscr_check_kdb_internal_check` do not test a plugin on an ASAN enabled build anymore, if you
  specify the status tag `memleak` in the plugin contract. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The [CFramework](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/TESTING.md) macro `compare_key` now also checks if the meta values of keys are equal.
  *(René Schwaiger)*
- The test `testscr_check_bashisms` does not print warnings about skipped files anymore. *(René Schwaiger)*
-  We added a [Markdown Shell Recorder][] test for the [`shell` plugin ](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/shell). *(René Schwaiger)*
- Added many storage plugin tests. Most tests use the keyset, key name and value APIs.
  Currently, the tests are only active for `dump` and `mmapstorage`. *(Mihael Pranjić)*
- The test `testcpp_contextual_basic` now compiles without warnings, if we use Clang 7 as compiler. *(René Schwaiger)*
- crypto, fcrypt and gpgme properly shut down the gpg-agent after the unit test is done. See #1973 . *(Peter Nirschl)*

## Build

### CMake

- We improved the detection of Python 2 and Python 3 in the CMake code of the Python bindings/plugins. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We restructured the code of the [CMake module](https://master.libelektra.org/cmake/Modules/FindHaskell.cmake) we use to detect Haskell
  tools . *(René Schwaiger)*
- The CMake configuration step now displays less debug messages about found libraries. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Building the Haskell binding should now work again. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Provide a wrapper around `check_symbol_exists` that handles issues with
  `-Werror -Wpedantic`. *(Lukas Winkler)*

### Docker

- <<TODO>>
- The docker images used by our build system are now available to download from
    our systems without authentication.
    Try it out and list available images via
        `docker run --rm anoxis/registry-cli -r https://hub-public.libelektra.org` .
    Afterwards pull your desired image as you would do from any public registry:
        `docker pull hub-public.libelektra.org/build-elektra-alpine:201809-791f9f388cbdff0db544e02277c882ad6e8220fe280cda67e6ea6358767a065e`.
    *(Lukas Winkler)*
- <<TODO>>

### Vagrant

- Added Vagrantfile for Ubuntu artful 32-bit. *(Mihael Pranjić)*

## Infrastructure

### Jenkins

- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- The build jobs now print less non-relevant output. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Enable `-Werror` in `debian-stable-full`. *(Lukas Winkler)
- Build Artifacts for all PR's to detect issues before merging *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Stricter removal of temporary docker images on docker nodes *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Added jenkins build jobs `debian-stable-full-mmap` and `debian-stable-full-mmap-asan`
  with `mmapstorage` as the default storage. *(Mihael Pranjić)*


### Travis

- Travis now also checks the code for memory leaks in the build job `🍏 Clang ASAN`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The Travis build job `🍏 Clang ASAN` now only translates a minimal set of plugins, since we had various timeout problems with this job
  before. We explicitly excluded plugins, to make sure that the build job still tests newly added plugins. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Added travis build job `🍏 mmap` on macOS with `mmapstorage` as the default storage. *(Mihael Pranjić)*
- Travis now prints the CMake configuration for each build job. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We now test Elektra using the latest version of Xcode (`10.0`). *(René Schwaiger)*
