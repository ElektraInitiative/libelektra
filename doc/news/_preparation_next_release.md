<a id="br-1"></a>

### Important Changes to Keynames

There have been significant changes to Elektra's Keynames.

- The most important change is that you now need a `:` after the namespace.
  So instead of `system/elektra/version` you have to use `system:/elektra/version`.

- The second big change is to array elements.
  From now on `keyNew ("/array/#10", KEY_END)` will create a `Key` with name `/array/#_10`, to make arrays more user-friendly while preserving numerical ordering.

- The whole internal implementation for `keySetName`, `keyAddName`, etc. has been completely rewritten.
  If you rely on specific behaviour of Elektra's Keynames and have already taken the two changes above into account, please refer to the newly created [Keyname documentation](../KEYNAMES.md) and [Python reference implementation](../../scripts/keynames.py).

- Metakeys now use the namespace `meta:/`.
  The accessor function `keyGetMeta` and `keySetMeta` automatically add this namespace to preserve compatibility.
  However, if you use the recently introduced `keyMeta` or otherwise directly access the keyname of a metakey, you will have to update your code.

- `default:/` is a new namespace used for keys that exist purely to represent a default value (e.g. generated by the `spec` plugin).

  Looking up cascading keys with `ksLookup` now looks at namespaces in the following order:

  - `proc:/`
  - `dir:/`
  - `user:/`
  - `system:/`
  - `default:/`
  - `/` (cascading key itself)

  The final lookup of the cascading key itself, will be removed in a future release.
  Please update your code to generate `default:/` keys, if you rely on this feature.

  Note: The `spec` plugin already generates `default:/` keys.

- The function `keyInactive` has been removed.
  The concept of inactive keys no longer exists, use [comment/#](/doc/METADATA.ini) instead.

- `ElektraNamespace` is the new C++ `enum class` for the Elektra's namespaces.
  You should prefer it to using `KEY_NS_SYSTEM` et al. directly, if you use C++.

- `keyGetFullName` et al. have been removed. The concept of a "full name (with owner)" no longer exists.

Updates since initial PR: <!-- TODO: remove for release -->

- Fix combining dot-dot parts and escapes in key names. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- Fix adding more than 10 warnings to a key. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

#### Mountpoint upgrade

The change to key names breaks existing mountpoint configurations.

It is not hard to fix the mountpoint configs even after the updating to the new version.

There are two places that will still contain the old syntax after the update:

1. Every key below (and including) `system:/elektra/mountpoints/<MOUNTPOINT>` uses an old key names as `<MOUNTPOINT>`, if the mountpoint was created with `kdb mount`.
2. The value of all keys matching `system:/elektra/mountpoints/*/mountpoint` must be valid key names.

Fixing the first instance is optional.
There the key name is just used to create a unique name for the mountpoint.

The second instance, however, must be fixed or Elektra will be unusable.

> **Disclaimer:** We cannot guarantee that the commands below work for all cases.
> We also make no guarantees that the command will not break things.
>
> _You have been warned. Manually backup important data first._

To fix both the `system:/elektra/mountpoints/*/mountpoint` values and the `system:/elektra/mountpoints/<MOUNTPOINT>` names, you can use the following command.

<!-- FIXME (kodebach): implement `kdb upgrade` -->

```sh
kdb upgrade pr3555 names values
```

If you just want to fix the `system:/elektra/mountpoints/*/mountpoint` values, but keep the old syntax for the mountpoint names, you can use this script:

```sh
kdb upgrade pr3555 values
```

> _Note:_ The original `system:/elektra/mountpoints` data will be moved to `system:/elektra/mountpoints-backup`

### Debian and Fedora Packaging with CPack

- We are now using CPack to generate modular Debian and Ubuntu packages. This simplifies the packaging process and solves problems where a PR that introduces changes to installed files, fails. We can now also set distribution specifc dependencies with CPack, which is needed for some packages. _(Robert Sowula)_
- We now also generate RPM packages for Fedora. _(Robert Sowula)_

### <<HIGHLIGHT3>>

### Cleanup

We removed the `ini` plugin (superseded by the TOML plugin), the `null` plugin (superseded by the base64 plugin) and the `tcl` plugin _(Markus Raab, Philipp Gackstatter)_

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [modules](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

### jni

- Fix rare memleak when the `jni` plugin is closed. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### mINI

- We changed the `provides` clause in the plugin contract. Now mINI offers support for the [properties format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) (`storage/properties`) instead of the INI file format (`storage/ini`). This makes sense, since the plugin never supported the [section syntax][] of INI files. _(René Schwaiger)_

[section syntax]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Sections

### Quickdump

- Support for the old quickdump v1 and v2 formats has been removed. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

### Simple INI

- The plugin contract now correctly states that the plugin offers support for the [properties format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties). Before it would state that the plugin offered support for the INI file format. This is not true, since the plugin does not support the [section syntax][] of the INI file format.

### YAML CPP

- We fixed an [use after free bug in the plugin](https://issues.libelektra.org/3561). _(René Schwaiger)_

### Yan LR

- The plugin now works (with and) requires [ANTLR `4.9`](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/releases/tag/4.9). _(René Schwaiger)_

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.

### Compatibility

- <a id="br-2"></a> We removed the fallback procedure introduced in Elektra 0.8.15 (using `KDB_DB_FILE` (`default.ecf`) for `system:/elektra`, if the bootstrap backend `KDB_DB_INIT` (`elektra.ecf`) isn't found).
  If you still rely on this feature, either use `kdb upgrade-bootstrap` **before** upgrading, or manually extract `system:/elektra` into `elektra.ecf`.
- <a id="br-3"></a> There was an internal update to how warnings are generated.
  For users this means that the `warnings` metadata now forms a proper array.
  Specifically, the first 100 warnings are stored below to the meta keys `warnings/#0`, `warnings/#1`, ..., `warnings/#9`, `warnings/#_10`, ..., `warnings/#_99`.
  After that, warnings will wrap around, so the 101st warning will be stored as `warnings/#0`, no. 102 as `warnings/#1` etc.
- <<TODO>>

### Core

- `kdbSet` now properly handles, if the given `parentKey` is `NULL` or has read-only name, value or metadata. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- <<TODO>>

### <<Library1>>

- <<TODO>>

### Proposal

- Removed `elektraKeyGetMetaKeySet` and moved `keySetStringF` to the hosts plugin. _(Philipp Gackstatter)_
- Removed `ksPopAtCursor`. _(Philipp Gackstatter)_
- <<TODO>>

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up to date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

### Lua

- Remove ipairs support and add our own iterator to add support for Lua 5.4, since `__ipairs` was deprecated. _(Manuel Mausz)_

### JNA

- Fixed allocation not correctly conveyed on key set initialization _(Michael Tucek)_

### C++

- `ElektraNamespace` is the new C++ `enum class` for the Elektra's namespaces. You should prefer it to using `KEY_NS_SYSTEM` et al. directly, if you use C++.
  The array `ELEKTRA_NAMESPACES` can be used to iterate over all namespaces. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

### Ruby

- Enable `__declspec` attributes for Ruby 3.0. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### <<Binding3>>

## Tools

- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- The QtGUI was updated to be compatible with the new key name structure. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

## Scripts

- We fixed the (possibly) infinitely running function `generate-random-string` in [check-env-dep](../../scripts/check-env-dep).

- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Build

### CMake

- Use Lua 5.4 when available. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- <<TODO>>
- Force `RTLD_NODELETE` on dlopen() when the `ENABLE_ASAN` CMake option is used. This enables ASAN to find symbols which otherwise might be unloaded. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- <<TODO>>

### Docker

- We added a Docker image for [building the documentation on Debian sid](../../scripts/docker/debian/sid/doc.Dockerfile). _(René Schwaiger)_
- We removed the Docker image for building the documentation on Debian Stretch. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Add Fedora 33 Dockerfile for Cirrus and Jenkins CI. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Infrastructure

### Cirrus

- Upgrade Cirrus Fedora docker image to Fedora 33. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Upgrade to Ruby 3.0 for macOS builds. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- <<TODO>>

### GitHub Actions

- We added a build job that translates Elektra with GCC on macOS. _(Mihael Pranjić, René Schwaiger)_

### Jenkins

- We now use Debian sid to build the documentation instead of Debian stretch. The Doxygen version in Debian stretch [contains a bug](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/6456) that causes the generation of the PDF documentation to fail. _(René Schwaiger)_
- Use Fedora 33 and 32, drop Fedora 31 use in Jenkins. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Update Release and Main pipeline to generate and publish packages for the same distributions with CPack (Debian Buster, Ubuntu Bionic, Ubuntu Focal, Fedora-33) _(Robert Sowula)_
- Add a stage to the release pipeline in which the generated packages are installed and tested. _(Robert Sowula)_

### Package Repositories

- We now provide release and unstable (master built) packages in our own repositories for Debian Buster, Ubuntu Bionic, Ubuntu Focal and Fedora-33. _(Robert Sowula)_

### Travis

- Move macOS GCC 10 build job to Github Actions. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
