We are proud to release Elektra 0.8.<<VERSION>>.

<<`scripts/git-release-stats 0.8.<<VERSION>>`>>

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

For a small demo see here:

## Highlights

- Type system preview
- Chef Cookbook
- Elektra Web 1.6


### Type system preview

Elektra supports specifying the semantics of keys via metakeys in the `spec`
namespace. An example is the metakey `check/range` which can be used to specify
that a key only holds numbers in a given range. Another metakey is `check/enum`
which only allows specific keywords to be the content of a key. Up to now these
semantics are being checked at runtime. Therefore a type system was developed to
be able to check configuration specifications statically. As an example, it
would detect when one accidentally adds both a range and an enum check if their
possible contents are not compatible with each other.

The type system is available as a plugin that gets mounted along with a
configuration specification into the spec namespace. Furthermore we include a
set of type definitions for commonly used metakeys such as `check/range`,
`check/long`, `fallback` or `override`.

For more details see the
[typechecker readme](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/typechecker)

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.


### Chef Cookbook

Next to the [Puppet Resource Type](http://puppet.libelektra.org/)
we now also prepared a [Chef Cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/kdb)
which allows us to use Elektra from within chef.

For example, to set mount a configuration file, you can use:

```
kdbmount 'system/hosts' do
	file '/etc/hosts'
	plugins 'hosts'
	action :create
end
```

And to add an hosts entry, you can use:

```
kdbset '/hosts/ipv4/showthatitworks' do
	namespace 'system'
	value '127.0.0.33'
	action :create
end
```

> Note that currently `kdb` is invoked
> and Elektra needs to be installed for
> managed systems.

Thanks to Michael Zronek and Vanessa Kos.


### Elektra Web 1.6

The new release of Elektra Web features many UX improvements from the usability test!

- implemented auto-deployment of webdemo.libelektra.org
- small fixes:
  - updated visibility levels
  - removed "done" button in main view
  - fixed issues with the opener click area
  - remove metakeys when they are set to the default value or empty/0
  - improved keyboard support
  - fixed many small issues (#2037)

1.6 changelog:

- fixed bugs related to arrays (#2103)
- improved performance of search for many results
- added 404 page for invalid instance ids

- add button to show error details
- allow deleting all keys in a namespace

Thanks to Daniel Bugl.


## Plugins

### CCode

- We fixed various warnings in the source code reported by [OCLint](http://oclint.org). *(René Schwaiger)*
- The plugin now also encodes and decodes key names in addition to key values. *(René Schwaiger)*

### CPP Template

- We added a new [template for C++ based plugins](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/cpptemplate). To create a plugin based on this
  template, please use the command

  ```sh
  scripts/copy-template -p pluginname
  ```

  , where `pluginname` specifies the name of your new plugin. *(René Schwaiger)*

### Crypto

- The `crypto` plugin now uses Elektra's `libinvoke` and the `base64` plugin in order to encode and decode Base64 strings. This improvement reduces code duplication between the two plugins. *(Peter Nirschl)*

### Directory Value

- The plugin now also adds leafs for a key, if its value is null or the empty string. *(René Schwaiger)*

### fcrypt

- The `fcrypt` plugin will consider the environment variable `TMPDIR` in order to detect its temporary directory. See [#1973] *(Peter Nirschl)*

### fstab

- The `fstab` plugin now passes tests on musl builds. *(Lukas Winkler)*

### Haskell

- An issue when building Haskell plugins with a cached sandbox is fixed in case
  a Haskell library bundled with elektra gets changed. *(Armin Wurzinger)*

### Interpreter Plugins

- The plugins Ruby, Python and Jni can now also be mounted as global plugin.
- Fix crashes in global Python plugin by using pluginprocess. *(Markus Raab and Armin Wurzinger)*
- Python plugin can now shutdown properly again *(Markus Raab)*

### JNI

- We now disable the plugin if  `BUILD_STATIC` or `BUILD_FULL` are enabled, since otherwise the plugin breaks the `kdb` tool.
  *(René Schwaiger)*
- We disabled the internal check (`testscr_check_kdb_internal_check`) for the plugin, since it always fails. *(René Schwaiger)*

### HexNumber

- The plugin [hexnumber](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/hexnumber) has been added. It can be used
  to convert hexadecimal values into decimal when read, and back to hexadecimal when written. *(Klemens Böswirth)*

### List

- The [`list` plugin](http://libelektra.org/plugins/list) now allows us to pass
  common configuration for all plugins by using keys below the "config/" setting.
  The updated plugin documentation contains more information and an example. *(Thomas Wahringer)*
- The [`list` plugin](http://libelektra.org/plugins/list) which is responsible
  for global mounting had a bug which prevented globally mounted plugins from
  being configurable. *(Thomas Wahringer)*

### mINI

- We fixed a memory leak in the [mINI plugin](https://libelektra.org/plugins/mini) by requiring the plugin
  [`ccode`](https://libelektra.org/plugins/ccode) instead of the “provider” `code`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Removed unused header files. *(René Schwaiger)*

### network

- Fixed an error in network plugin that prevented it from working on non glibc
    platforms. *(Lukas Winkler)*

### Regex Dispatcher

- The plugin [regexdispatcher](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/regexdispatcher) has been added.
  It calculates regex representations for commonly used specification keywords to be used with the
  [typechecker](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/typechecker). Currently the keywords `check/range`,
  `check/enum` and `default` are supported. *(Armin Wurzinger)*

### Typechecker

- The plugin [typechecker](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/typechecker), used to validate
  configuration specifications for Elektra statically, has been improved under the hood. It now
  supports a more concise and efficient typechecking process including a greatly
  improved type inference scheme that should make generated specification files and thus
  generated errors to be easier to understand. An example of such error message is shown in the
  [readme](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/typechecker) *(Armin Wurzinger)*

### Tcl

- The [`tcl`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/tcl) plugin does not fail anymore, if its configuration file does not exist and you try to
  retrieve the plugin contract. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The plugin now uses relative key names. This update addresses issue [#51](https://issues.libelektra.org/51). *(René Schwaiger)*

### YAJL

- The [YAJL Plugin](http://libelektra.org/plugins/yajl) now uses the internal logger functionality instead of `printf` statements.
  *(René Schwaiger)*
- We fixed a problem with negative values reported by the
  [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html). *(René Schwaiger)*

### YAML CPP

- The plugin does not save empty intermediate keys anymore. The example below shows the old and the new behavior of the plugin:

   ```sh
   # Mount plugin
   kdb mount config.yaml /tests/yamlcpp yamlcpp
   # Store single key-value pair
   kdb set /tests/yamlcpp/level1/level2/level3 value

   # Old behavior
   kdb ls /tests/yamlcpp
   #> user/tests/yamlcpp/level1
   #> user/tests/yamlcpp/level1/level2
   #> user/tests/yamlcpp/level1/level2/level3

   # New behavior
   kdb ls /tests/yamlcpp
   user/tests/yamlcpp/level1/level2/level3
   ```
   . *(René Schwaiger)*

- [YAML CPP](http://libelektra.org/plugins/yamlcpp) now requires at least `yaml-cpp 0.6`, since the current
  [MSR test for the plugin](https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/yamlcpp/README.md) triggers two bugs:

  - https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/issues/247
  - https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/issues/289

  in earlier versions of the [yaml-cpp library](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp). *(René Schwaiger)*

- The plugin does now support [arrays](https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/arrays) containing empty fields. *(René Schwaiger)*

### YAML Smith

- [YAML Smith](http://libelektra.org/plugins/yamlsmith) is a plugin that converts Elektra’s `KeySet` data structure to a textual
  representation in the [YAML][] serialization format. The plugin is currently in a **very early stage of development**. Please be advised,
  that it is quite likely that the plugin will produce incorrect or even invalid YAML data, especially if your `KeySet` contains special
  characters.

### Yan LR

- The experimental [Yan LR plugin](http://libelektra.org/plugins/yanlr) uses a parser, generated by [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org) to read
  basic [YAML][] data. The plugin only converts YAML data to Elektra’s `KeySet` data structure. If you want to write data in the YAML
  format please take a look at the [YAML Smith plugin](http://libelektra.org/plugins/yamlsmith). *(René Schwaiger)*

### Misc

- The logging plugins ["syslog"](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/syslog),
  ["journald"](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/journald) and
  ["logchange"](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/logchange) now have a new
  option called "get" which can be enabled to log which configuration settings
  are loaded by applications.
  The new option can be used for logging application behavior when using
  [notifications](https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/notifications). *(Thomas Wahringer)*
- Do not exclude `simpleini` silently on non-glibc systems but output a message
  like for other plugins *(Markus Raab)*

[YAML]: http://yaml.org

## Libraries

### Core

- We updated the `infos/status` clause of the following plugins:

  - [`boolean`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/boolean),
  - [`constants`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/constants),
  - [`csvstorage`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/csvstorage),
  - [`hexnumber`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/hexnumber),
  - [`internalnotification`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/internalnotification),
  - [`ruby`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/ruby),
  - [`simpleini`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/simpleini),
  - [`uname`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/uname), and
  - [`xerces`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/xerces)

  . *(René Schwaiger)*

### General

- replaced strdup with elektraStrDup (for C99 compatibility) *(Markus Raab)*

- <<TODO>>

### pluginprocess

- The library [`pluginprocess`](http://master.libelektra.org/src/libs/pluginprocess) that is used to
  execute plugins run inside own processes has been improved. This is useful as some plugins like
  haskell-based plugins or [`python`](http://libelektra.org/plugins/python) can only be started once
  inside a single process, while libelektra may call a plugin several times. The library now uses an
  improved communication protocol that separates between pluginprocess-related data and keysets
  passed to plugins. This avoids any possible name clashes between keys used by a plugin and keys
  used by pluginprocess.
  The documentation of the plugin has been improved as well, some mistakes were corrected and it
  should be more clear how to store plugin data besides pluginprocess's data structure.
  Tests have been added to the library to ensure its correct functionality. *(Armin Wurzinger)*

## Bindings

- A new I/O binding for [ev](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/io_ev) has been
  added.
  It can be used to integrate the notification feature with applications based
  on [ev](http://libev.schmorp.de) main loops. *(Thomas Wahringer)*



## Tools

- The new tool `kdb find` lists keys of the database matching a certain regular expression. *(Markus Raab)*
- You can now build the [Qt-GUI](https://www.libelektra.org/tools/qt-gui) using Qt `5.11`. *(René Schwaiger)*

## Scripts

- The script [`check_formatting.sh`](https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/check_formatting.sh) now also checks the formatting of CMake
  code if you installed [`sponge`](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils) and [`cmake-format`][]. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The script [`check_formatting.sh`](https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/check_formatting.sh) now no longer writes to stdout if clang-format5.0
    can not be found. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The script [`check_bashisms.sh`](https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/check_bashisms.sh) should now work correctly again, if the
  system uses the GNU version `find`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The script [`reformat-cmake`](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/reformat-cmake) now checks if `cmake-format` works before it reformats CMake files. Thank you to Klemens Böswirth for the [detailed description of the problem](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/pull/1903#discussion_r189332987). *(René Schwaiger)*
- `scripts/run_icheck` now no longer leaves the base directory of the project
  when checking if the ABI changed. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The completion for [fish](http://fishshell.com) now also suggest the `info/` meta attributes of the
  [file plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/file). *(René Schwaiger)*

### Copy Template

- The script [`copy-template`](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/copy-template) is now location independent. It will always create a
  new plugin in `src/plugins`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The command now also supports the new [template for C++ based plugins](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/cpptemplate). Please use the
  command line switch `-p` to create a new plugin based on `cpptemplate`.

[`cmake-format`]: https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format

## Documentation

- We improved the formatting of our [compilation guide](/doc/COMPILE.md). *(René Schwaiger)*
- We fixed various minor spelling mistakes in the documentation. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The man pages for [`kdb change-resolver-symlink`](https://www.libelektra.org/manpages/kdb-change-resolver-symlink) and
   [`kdb change-storage-symlink`](https://www.libelektra.org/manpages/kdb-change-storage-symlink) referenced the wrong command.
   *(Lukas Winkler, René Schwaiger)*
- We added documentation for our build system in
    [BUILDSERVER.md](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/BUILDSERVER.md).
    *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The documentation for `kdb` and `kdb set` now mentions the `--` argument that stops processing of command line switches. This is useful
  for setting negative values among other things. *(Klemens Böswirth)*
- We added a new tutorial to use tha jna binding. The tutorial shows how to use the java library to interact with kdb *(Michael Zronek)*
- GitHub now detects the license of the repository correctly again. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We added a tutorial describing Elektra’s [array data type](https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/arrays). *(René Schwaiger)*


## Tests

- We added new [Markdown Shell Recorder][] tests for the
  - [`ccode`](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/ccode),
  - [`file`](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/file),
  - [`iconv`](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/iconv),
  - [`ni`](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/ni),
  - [`rename`](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/rename), and
  - [`uname`](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/uname)
  plugin. *(René Schwaiger)*
- (Markdown) Shell Recorder tests now save test data below `/tests` (see issue [#1887][]). *(René Schwaiger)*
- The Markdown Shell Recorder checks `kdb set` commands to ensure we only add tests that store data below `/tests`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The Markdown Shell Recorder now supports indented code blocks. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The Markdown Shell Recorder now also tests if a command prints nothing to `stdout` if you add the check `#>`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We fixed some problems in the [Markdown Shell Recorder](https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper) test
  of [`kdb ls`](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-ls.md). *(René Schwaiger)*
- The `add_plugin` helper now respects `ENABLE_KDB_TESTING` when adding
    Markdown Shell Recorder tests. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The Markdown Shell Recorder test for [`kdb find`](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-find.md) now removes the configuration file
  at the end of the test. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The [Shell Recorder](https://master.libelektra.org/tests/shell/shell_recorder) now properly unmounts any additional mountpoints created
    during a test. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We removed the broken auto unmounting feature from the [Markdown Shell Recorder][]. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Plugins added with the flag `SHARED_ONLY` no longer get tested in the script `check_kdb_internal_check.sh` if executed with kdb-full or kdb-static. *(Armin Wurzinger)*
- Add `compare_regex_to_line_files` which allows to compare a file made of
    regex patterns to be compared with a text file line by line.
    *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The OPMPHM has a new test case *(Kurt Micheli)*
- Do not execute `fcrypt` and `crypto` unit tests if the `gpg` binary is not available. *(Peter Nirschl)*
- Resolved an issue where tests did not cleanup properly after they ran.
    This was especially noticeable for `gpg` tests as the `gpg-agents` that were
    spawned did not get cleaned up afterwards. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- We disabled the general plugin test (`testkdb_allplugins`) for the [`semlock` plugin](https://libelektra.org/plugins/mini), since the
  test reported [memory leaks](https://issues.libelektra.org/2113) on the latest version of Debian Unstable. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The [CFramework](https://master.libelektra.org/tests/cframework) macro `compare_keyset` now supports the comparison of two empty key sets. *(René Schwaiger)*

## Build

### CMake

- The build system no longer installs Haskell dependencies from hackage by itself, instead
  this has to be done beforehand like it is the case with all other dependencies. The main
  reason is that the build servers shouldn't compile the dependencies over and over again,
  only if something changes. See the [readme](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/haskell). *(Armin Wurzinger)*
- Plugins can be specified to be only built for `BUILD_SHARED` builds, but to be excluded
  from any `BUILD_FULL` or `BUILD_STATIC` builds using the new optional argument `ONLY_SHARED`
  for our cmake macro `add_plugin`. This way `BUILD_SHARED` can be combined with the other
  options without excluding such plugins. The cmake messages about plugin inclusion have
  been updated to indicate this behavior. This behavior has been applied for the Haskell
  plugins- and bindings as they currently don't support full or static builds. *(Armin Wurzinger)*
- We now import the current version of [Google Test][] as external project at configuration time using
   [DownloadProject](https://github.com/Crascit/DownloadProject). If you want to use a local installation of
   [Google Test][] instead, please set the value of `GTEST_ROOT` to the path of you local copy of the
   [Google Test][] framework. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The cmake variable `GTEST_ROOT` now respects the environment variable
  `GTEST_ROOT` if it is set. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The build system does not install [Google Test][] anymore if you install Elektra. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We disabled the test `testlib_notification` on ASAN enabled builds, since Clang reports that the test leaks memory. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Disable Markdown Shell Recorder test `validation.md` for ASAN builds.
  It leaks memory and thus fails the test during spec mount. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Haskell plugins and bindings are now correctly excluded when using `BUILD_FULL` or `BUILD_STATIC`
  as this is currently unsupported. Another issue when building Haskell plugins with a cached sandbox
  is fixed as well. *(Armin Wurzinger)*
- Fix compilation with `BUILD_TESTING=OFF` when `spec` or `list` plugins are not selected.
- Set coverage prefix to `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`, resulting in easier readable
    coverage reports. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- The functions `add_plugintest` and `add_plugin` now also support adding a C++ test instead of a C test. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The function `add_plugintest` now also supports setting environment variables for C/C++ based tests. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The build system now automatically detects Homebrew’s OpenSSL version on macOS. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We improved the automatic detection of Libgcrypt and OpenSSL. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Resolved an issue where cmake did not properly set test feature macros to detect and use libc functionality. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Improve the detection of `ftw.h`, if the current build use the compiler switch `-Werror`. *(René Schwaiger)*

[Google Test]: https://github.com/google/googletest

### Docker

- `clang-5.0` is now used for clang tests by the build system *(Lukas Winkler)*
- An additional build job on Ubuntu:xenial has been added *(Lukas Winkler)*
- `withDockerEnv` Jenkinsfile helper now no longer provides stages automatically. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- [Google Test][] is installed in Docker images used by the build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*

## Infrastructure

### Jenkins

- A build job checks if PRs modify the release notes. *(Markus Raab)*
- Several improvements to the build system have been implemented *(Lukas Winkler)*:
  - Better Docker image handling.
  - Abort of previously queued but unfinished runs on new commits.
  - Document how to locally replicate the Docker environment used for tests.
- The Jenkins build server now also compiles and tests Elektra with enabled address sanitizer. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Add `STATIC` and `FULL` linked builds. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Ported GCC ASAN build job to new build system *(René Schwaiger + Lukas Winkler)*
- Docker artifacts are now cleaned up in our daily build job. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- `clang` tests have been ported to the new build system *(Lukas Winkler et al)*
- `icheck` build server job has been ported to our new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-gcc-configure-debian-optimizations` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-gcc-configure-mingw-w64` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `debian-multiconfig-gcc-stable` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-ini-mergerequests` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-gcc-configure-debian-nokdbtest` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-gcc-configure-xdg`to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-gcc-i386` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Port `elektra-gcc-configure-debian-musl` to new build system. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Docker Registry is cleaned up by our daily buildserver task. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Remove `elektra-gcc-configure-debian-nokdbtest` test. Instead we are now
    removing write permissions of Elektra's paths to detect if we write to the
    filesystem even though tests are not tagged as such. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Remove `elektra-gcc-configure-debian-withspace` test. We now test for
    compatibility of spaced build paths during normal tests. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Check for source formatting during early test stages. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Remove the amount of spawned tests via not running a full multiconfig setup for
  the `PLUGINS=NODEP` config. They did not provide any additional coverage.
  Instead we added a new test checking if `PLUGINS=NODEP` builds in an minimal
  Docker image. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Speed up coverage data upload. *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Fix an issue where file archiving did not happen because of suppressed shell
    expansion *(Lukas Winkler)*
- Setup mailing for jenkins *(Lukas Winkler)*
  - send mail to build@libelektra.org when `master` fails *(Lukas Winkler)*
  - parse change list into mail *(Lukas Winkler)*
  - do not send mails if pipeline run was aborted *(Lukas Winkler)*

### Travis

- Travis now uses the latest version of GCC and Clang to translate Elektra on Linux. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Our Travis build job now
  - builds all (applicable) bindings by default again, and
  - checks the formatting of CMake code via [`cmake-format`][]
  . *(René Schwaiger)*
- Some cache issues on the Travis build job for cached haskell sandboxes have been resolved. *(Armin Wurzinger)*
- Travis caches downloaded Homebrew packages to improve the reliability of macOS build jobs. *(René Schwaiger)*
- Travis is now using Xcode 9.4.1 on macOS 10.13 for most macOS build jobs. *(Mihael Pranjić)*
- We added a unique name to each build job, so you can see quickly which configuration caused problems. *(René Schwaiger)*
- We now specify custom binding, plugin and tool configuration for jobs via the environment variables:

  - `BINDINGS`,
  - `PLUGINS`, and
  - `TOOLS`

  . We also added environment variables for the build configuration options `BUILD_FULL`, `COMMON_FLAGS`, and
  `ENABLE_ASAN`. *(René Schwaiger)*
- The macOS ASAN build job now only builds the `kdb` tool, since we hit the
  [job timeout for public repositories](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#build-timeouts) for this specific job quite
  often. *(René Schwaiger)*

## Compatibility

As always, the ABI and API of kdb.h is fully compatible, i.e. programs
compiled against an older 0.8 version of Elektra will continue to work
(ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

## Website

The website is generated from the repository, so all information about
plugins, bindings and tools are always up to date. Furthermore, we changed:

- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Outlook

We are currently working on following topics:

- The hybrid search algorithm for the Key search `ksLookup (...)` is now in preparation.
  The preparation includes a new KeySet flag `KS_FLAG_NAME_CHANGE`, this flag will be used by the hybrid search.
  The hybrid search combines the best properties of the binary search and the [OPMPHM](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/dev/data-structures.md#order-preserving-minimal-perfect-hash-map-aka-opmphm).
  The hybrid search uses a modified branch predictor to predicts KeySet changes and decides if binary search or OPMPHM would be faster. *(Kurt Micheli)*
