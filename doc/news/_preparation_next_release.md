We are proud to release Elektra 0.9.<<VERSION>>.

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.

## Highlights

- Code generation
- <<HIGHLIGHT2>>
- <<HIGHLIGHT3>>

### Code Generation

While the new `kdb gen` was already included in the last release, it is now fully functional and ready for use. To get started take a look
at the new man-page for [`kdb-gen(1)`](https://www.libelektra.org/manpages/kdb-gen). _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

If specifically want to use it with the High-Level API take a look at [this tutorial](https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/high-level-api).

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [modules](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

- We removed 9 obsolete or unfinished plugins: boolean cachefilter cpptype dini enum regexstore required simplespeclang struct. _(Markus Raab)_

### GOpts

- The error message, if non of the gopts variants can be compiled, was improved. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_
- A better error, if the plugin fails to load `argv` from the system, was added. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

### Tcl

- We made sure that building the plugin works, if you use the latest version of CMake (`3.15.3`) and Boost (`1.71`). _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_

### YAwn

- We removed the plugin in favor of [Yan LR](../../src/plugins/yanlr/README.md). _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_

### YAy PEG

- We removed the plugin in favor of [Yan LR](../../src/plugins/yanlr/README.md). _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_

### Type

- We added an option to disable the restoring of boolean values. This useful for storage formats like YAML that have
  native boolean types. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

### Noresolver

- The plugin now correctly sets the path in the `parentKey`. It therefore now supports set calls. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

### Specload

- We now treat relative paths as relative to `KDB_DB_SPEC` instead of the current working directory. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.

### Compatibility

- The conversion functions `elektraKeyTo*` and `elektra*ToString` are now part of the `elektra-ease` library instead of
  the `elektra-highlevel` library. This should not cause any breaking changes since `elektra-highlevel` already depends
  on `elektra-ease`. In addition the header `elektra/conversion.h` is kept for compatibility. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

### Core

- A new plugin function, `kdbCommit`, was implemented. The function is carried out in the `commit` phase of `kdbSet` and separates the commit functionality from the `kdbSet()` function. _(Vid Leskovar)_
- `kdbconfig.h` is no longer included in the installed headers. This is because it could cause conflicts with other
  `config.h`-type headers from applications. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_
- `kdb.h` was moved into the subfolder `elektra`, to prevent conflicts with header files with the same name. `kbd.h` can now be included via `elektra/kdb.h`. _(Jakob Fischer)_

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up to date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

- Warnings about cmake policies are avoided. _(Markus Raab)_

### Java

- Upgraded maven dependencies for java binding _(Michael Zronek)_
- <<TODO>>

### Rust

- Add the `elektra-sys` crate which contains raw bindings to libelektra for Rust. _(Philipp Gackstatter)_

### <<Binding3>>

## Tools

- kdb can call [cmerge](../help/kdb-cmerge.md) and specify a [strategy](../help/elektra-cmerge-strategy.md) to resolve conflicts. _(Dominic J√§ger)_
- Checks for `kdbCommit` have been added to [kdb check](../help/kdb-check.md). _(Vid Leskovar)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Scripts

- The script [run_icheck](../../scripts/run_icheck) now also work correctly, if the last entry of [`icheck.suppression`](../../tests/icheck.suppression) does not end with a newline character. _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_
- The script [`draw-all-plugins`](../../scripts/draw-all-plugins) now also works properly, if the repository path contains space characters. _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_
- The script [`link-checker`](../../scripts/link-checker) now deduplicates the list of links before checking them. The timeout and amount of retries was also reduced.
  Lastly the script now supports a whitelist. Any link stored in [`tests/linkchecker.whitelist`](../../tests/linkchecker.whitelist) will not be checked. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_

## Documentation

- Added decision for array concept of warnings. _(Michael Zronek)_
- We updated our [Doxygen configuration file](../../doc/Doxyfile), removing the outdated `PERL_PATH` and `MSCGEN_PATH` options. _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_
- Added a tutorial on how to write language bindings. Visit our new [README](../tutorials/language-bindings.md).
  _(Michael Zronek, Raphael Gruber, Philipp Gackstatter)_
- A [second tutorial](../tutorials/highlevel-bindings.md) on writing bindings for the high-level API was created as well. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_
- <<TODO>>

## Tests

- We changed how the [formatting test](../../tests/shell/check_formatting.sh) detects code differences. This update should get rid of transient errors as [reported here](https://issues.libelektra.org/2927#issuecomment-528058641). _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Build

### CMake

- `kdbtypes.h` is now generated directly via a CMake `configure_file` call. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

### Compilation

- We now have a [setup for proper symbol versioning](../dev/symbol-versioning.md). _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_
- We do not use implicit typing in the code of the `conditionals` plugin any more. After this update, the code compiles without any warnings, even though we now use the compiler switch `-Wconversion`. _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_

### Docker

- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

### Other

- The reformatting script now checks that the correct version of `cmake-format` is used. _(Klemens B√∂swirth, Ren√© Schwaiger)_

## Infrastructure

### Cirrus

- The `üîó Check` build job now merges PRs before checking links. _(Klemens B√∂swirth)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

### Jenkins

- We upgraded all servers to buster so that debian buster docker image work. _(Markus Raab)_
- We now also build Debian buster packages. _(Markus Raab)_
- Enable WebUI build job again. _(Markus Raab)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

### Travis

- The build job `üçè GCC` now uses the [Travis Homebrew addon](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/installing-dependencies/#installing-packages-on-macos) to install dependencies. _(Ren√© Schwaiger)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Website

The website is generated from the repository, so all information about
plugins, bindings and tools are always up to date. Furthermore, we changed:

- The Website now lives in the folders [website-frontend](/src/tools/website-frontend) and [website-backend](/src/tools/website-backend) to avoid confusion with the REST backend of the Web-UI. _(Markus Raab)_
- <<TODO>>
- <<TODO>>

## Outlook

We are currently working on following topics:

- Merge tool in C99 (the same language as the core of Elektra). This is planned to supersede the existing merge tool. The goal is to reduce the number of merge conflicts in contrast to regular merge tools using the specific semantics of configuration files. _(Dominic J√§ger)_
