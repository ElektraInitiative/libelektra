- shortDesc: TOML Storage Plugin

We are proud to release Elektra 0.9.3.
This release again brings us a big step towards Elektra 1.0.
It introduces the new soon-to-be-default storage plugin: TOML.

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

You can also read the news [on our website](https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.3-release)

You can try out the latest Elektra release using our docker image [elektra/elektra](https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra).
This is the quickest way to get started with Elektra without compiling and other obstacles, simply run
`docker run -it elektra/elektra`.

## TOML

The highlight of this release is the [TOML plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/toml).
The TOML plugin has a similar huge feature set as the INI plugin,
but is written in a much cleaner and more maintainable way using flex and bison.
Furthermore, it follows the popular [TOML spec](https://toml.io).

It has nearly no run-time dependency, it only needs `base64` if binary values are needed.

A huge thanks to Jakob Fischer for this amazing work!

> Warning: In one of the following `0.9.*` releases, INI will be removed and TOML will become the
> default plugin. If you are using INI, please migrate to TOML now.

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [plugins](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

### xmltool

- Values of KDBStream changed to fit with elektraKeyFlags: recompilation of application is needed. _(Markus Raab)_

### TOML

- Added the [TOML plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/toml), which can read and write TOML files using flex and bison. _(Jakob Fischer)_
- Removed the `null` plugin dependency of the plugin. _(Jakob Fischer)_
- The `type` metakey is now set for numbers on reading. _(Jakob Fischer)_

### dump

- The `dump` plugin got a major update. The new version can read old files, but only write new files.
  The new files **cannot** be read by the old version of the plugin and will result in a "version error" message. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The new version stores keynames relative to the mountpoint, so exported `dump` files can now be imported into a different mountpoint. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `dump` no longer writes unnecessary zero-bytes into files. This means that as long as all key-values are human-readable, so is the `dump` output.
  This makes `dump` usable for tests and demo purposes, as it is a very simple format closely modelled after a KeySet's structure.
  This also makes it much easier to manually fix broken `dump` files.
  You only need a text editor most of the time. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

## Compatibility

Elektra `0.9.*` does not make any compatibility promises, as we want a clean 1.0.0 release.
In this release, we did the following changes:

- `keyswitch_t` renamed to elektraKeyFlags. _(Markus Raab)_
- `option_t` renamed to elektraLockFlags and elektraLookupFlags. _(Markus Raab)_
- `cursor_t` renamed to elektraCursor. _(Markus Raab)_

> Note: We made this release before merging larger changes.
> Please expect more fundamental changes in the next releases.

### Errors

- Improved error messages. _(Markus Raab)_

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up-to-date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

### JNA

- Made examples work again. _(Markus Raab)_

## Scripts

- Fix googletest framework path in debian configure script. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- The [fish completion script](../../scripts/completion/kdb.fish) does not fail any more, if you try to complete a simple
  command that expects a namespace. For example, completing

  ```sh
  kdb ls ‸
  ```

  with the tab key (<kbd>⇥</kbd>) (`‸` represents the current cursor position) should work correctly again. _(René Schwaiger)_

- The formatting scripts using prettier now use [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), which is included in `npm`
  v5.2.0 or newer. This allows us to specify an exact version of prettier to use. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The `reformat-shell` script now accepts the alias `shfmt2`, in case `shfmt` v3 is needed for another project. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The config for restyled.io now specifies the image to use for each formatter. This clearly reflects the version used for
  formatting. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- Add a release script to automate the release process. _(Robert Sowula)_

## Documentation

- Updated [GOALS.md](http://www.libelektra.org/docgettingstarted/goals). _(Markus Raab)_
- Describe hierarchy and limitations of [hosts plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/hosts). _(Markus Raab)_
- The Doxygen PDF documentation now also requires the packages
  - `stix` (part of `texlive-fonts-extra`) and
  - `stmaryrd` (part of `texlive-science` or `texlive-math-extra`). _(René Schwaiger)_
- Write down some fundamental [decisions](https://www.libelektra.org/decisions/readme),
  mostly about key names and key set structure. _(Markus Raab in discussions with Klemens Böswirth)_

## Tests

- Fixed the `is_not_rw_storage` function. _(Lukas Kilian)_
- We now ensure that the `check_import` and `check_export` tests run for at least one plugin. _(Lukas Kilian)_

## Build

### CMake

- `make uninstall` also uninstalls symlinks. _(Markus Raab)_
- `external-links.txt` and `extra_install_manifest.txt` are cleaned up at CMake runs. _(Markus Raab)_
- Increased CTest timeout for `testscr_check_kdb_internal_suite` due to timouts reached on slow test machines. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### Docker

- Added Alpine Linux docker image with latest Elektra installed. This image is published on docker hub as [elektra/elektra](https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra).
  We will update the image for each Elektra release such that novices can easily test Elektra without compiling or installing. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Remove unused `libgtest-dev` from docker images. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Add Ubuntu Focal (20.04) docker image. _(Robert Sowula)_
- Update Alpine Linux docker image to 3.12.1. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

## Infrastructure

### Cirrus

- Update FreeBSD images from version 11.3 to 11.4. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Increase CPU count for containers to 4. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Use Ruby 2.7 on macOS. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Export Python 3.8 path for macOS builds. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### Jenkins

- Temporarily resolve cyclic dependency between go-elektra and libelektra builds. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Add a new Jenkinsfile for release automation. _(Robert Sowula)_
- Our release pipeline now also builds deb packages for Ubuntu Focal (20.04). _(Robert Sowula)_

### Travis

- Update macOS builds to use GCC 10, Ruby 2.7.1 and Xcode 12.2. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Increase wait time on builds to fix build timeout errors ("No output has been received in the last 10m0s"). _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Export Python 3.9 path for macOS builds. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

## Website

The website is generated from the repository, so all information about
plugins, bindings and tools are always up-to-date. Furthermore, we changed:

- Renamed the source folder of the [website](/src/tools/website) and removed the backend. _(Markus Raab)_
- Use strict dependency injection for website modules. _(Marvin Mall)_
- Added `package-lock.json` to ensure repeatable builds. _(Marvin Mall)_
