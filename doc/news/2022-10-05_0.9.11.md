- shortDesc: New Backend System, Opensesame Application, FLOSS Course

We are proud to release Elektra 0.9.11.

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

You can also read the news [on our website](https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.11-release).

You can try out the latest Elektra release using our Docker image [elektra/elektra](https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra).
This is the quickest way to get started with Elektra without compiling and other obstacles, simply run:

```sh
docker pull elektra/elektra
docker run -it elektra/elektra
```

## Highlights

- Preparing new-backend merge
- Olimex
- Improving Elektra in FLOSS course

### Preparing new-backend merge

In a separated branch we rewrote the whole backend system.
With this new backend system, backends are now also plugins, allowing backends also to be non-file-based, e.g., using databases.
The main purpose of this release is to give a last stable release before master gets disrupted with a huge changeset.
The next release is not to be expected in this year.

A huge thanks to _(Klemens Böswirth @kodebach)_, _(Maximilian Irlinger @atmaxinger)_ for the many changes in the branch.
Thanks to _(Richard Stöckl @Eiskasten)_ for testing.

### Olimex

Elektra is used for [server, desktop and embedded](/doc/WHO.md).
With this release, we strengthen our embedded mainstay, specifically in [open source hardware OSHW](https://freedomdefined.org/OSHW).
We developed a major application running on OSHW [Olimex](https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/open-source-hardware) boards.
The application is called [opensesame](https://opensesame.libelektra.org).
It is heavily relying on Elektra and [ansible-libelektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/ansible-libelektra).

In the initial release [opensesame](https://opensesame.libelektra.org) already allows:

- [x] opening (garage) doors via a novel PIN entry method: you can press and release buttons in any sequence
- [x] switching on entry lights
- [x] ringing doorbells
- [x] detection of fire
- [x] report events to Nextcloud chats (English and German)

To give a smoother experience when running such an application we will develop Ansible scripts to customize the Olimex base images.
They will allow changing the language, time zone, static network configuration etc.

Olimex likes this idea and will send us an A20 board.
A big thanks to [Olimex](https://www.olimex.com).

### Improving Elektra in FLOSS course

Also in the [upcoming term](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?courseNr=194114&semester=2022W) Elektra will be object of study how FLOSS initiatives work.
Students will make improvements in Elektra as part of their homework, teamwork and, if chosen, also for their project.
Alternatively, they can also improve other self-chosen FLOSS initiatives.
