- shortDesc: Java Binding Improvements, Breaking Change to `kdbOpen`

We are proud to release Elektra 0.9.5.

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

You can also read the news [on our website](https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.5-release)

You can try out the latest Elektra release using our docker image [elektra/elektra](https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra).
This is the quickest way to get started with Elektra without compiling and other obstacles, simply run
`docker run -it elektra/elektra`.

## Highlights

- Breaking change to `kdbOpen`. _[see below](#hl-1)_
- Ongoing improvements of Java bindings and publishing of bindings to maven central for easy dependency integrations in Java projects

<a id="hl-1"></a>

### `kdbOpen` Contracts

The signature of `kdbOpen` has been changed from

```c
KDB *  kdbOpen (Key * errorKey);
```

to

```c
KDB * kdbOpen(const KeySet * contract, Key *parentKey);
```

You can use `kdbOpen (NULL, errorKey)` to get the same behavior as before.

The new parameter `contract` is similar to what could be done via `kdbEnsure` (which has been removed).
Currently, the contract allows you to mount global plugins and add data into the global KeySet (passed to all plugins)
during `kdbOpen`. This alone is already quite powerful, but we might more functionality in future releases.

For now, there are three use cases for the `contract` parameter. All of them are covered by helper functions:

```c
int elektraGOptsContract (KeySet * contract, int argc, const char * const * argv, const char * const * envp, const Key * parentKey, KeySet * goptsConfig);
int elektraIoContract (KeySet * contract, ElektraIoInterface * ioBinding);
int elektraNotificationContract (KeySet * contract);
```

With `elektraGOptsContract` you can mount and set up the `gopts` plugin used for command-line argument parsing.
The other two functions are the new way to configure Elektra's notification feature.

For more information take a look at [doc/dev/kdb-contracts.md](../dev/kdb-contracts.md)

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [plugins](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

### Cache

- The `cache` plugin now only caches the parts of the global keyset that are below `system:/elektra/cache` or below
  `system:/elektra/cached`. The part below `system:/elektra/cache` is meant for internal data of the `cache`, so you
  should put data below `system:/elektra/cached`, if you want it to be cached. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

### internalnotification

- Fix use of `kdb_long_double_t` on armel platforms ([#3450](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues/3450)). _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### Dbus & Dbusrecv

- Internal changes to ensure compatibility with the new `elektraNotificationContract`. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

### YAML Smith & Yan LR

- Removed plugins `yamlsmith` and `yanlr`. _(René Schwaiger)_

### Zeromqsend & Zeromqrecv

- Internal changes to ensure compatibility with the new `elektraNotificationContract`. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.

### Compatibility

- `keyCopy` and `keyDup` now take an additional flag. See [below](#key-copy).
- `kdbEnsure` was removed and integrated into `kdbOpen`, which now takes an additional `KeySet * contract` parameter. See [above](#hl-1)

### Core

<a id="key-copy"></a>

- The `keyCopy` and `keyDup` functions have been changed. They now take a `flags` argument which specifies which parts
  of the `Key` should be copied.
  The API also changed slightly. Most importantly `NULL` values are handled differently. For example, `keyDup (NULL, KEY_CP_ALL)`
  returns a key similar to what `keyNew ("/", KEY_END)` produces, whereas previously `keyDup (NULL)` returned `NULl`.
  _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- We added `keyReplacePrefix`, a function that allows you to easily move a key from one parent to another. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `kdbEnsure` was removed and replaced by similar functionality added to `kdbOpen`. _[see above](#hl-1)_ _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- `KEY_END` is now defined as `(void *) 0` instead of `0`. This allows us to mark `keyNew` with the GCC attribute
  `__attribute__ ((sentinel))`, which causes a compiler warning, if `keyNew` calls don't use `KEY_END` as their last argument.
  _(Klemens Böswirth)_

### Io

- `elektraSetIoBinding` has been removed. Use `elektraIoContract` instead. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

### Notification

- `elektraNotificationOpen` has been removed. Use `elektraNotificationContract` instead.
  `elektraNotificationClose` has also been removed. There is no replacement, cleanup now happens automatially during
  `kdbClose`. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The contract for transport plugins has been changed. The exported functions `"openNotification"`, `"closeNotification" and`"setIoBinding"`are no longer used. Instead, plugins should retrieve the I/O binding from the key`system:/elektra/io/binding`in the global keyset. The notification callback and context that were passed to`"openNotification"`, can now be read from the global keyset as well. The keys are`system:/elektra/notification/callback`and`system:/elektra/notification/context` respectively.
  _(Klemens Böswirth)_

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up-to-date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

### JNA

- Since internal iterator support for `KeySet` is due to being dropped, the following methods have been removed:

  - `Elektra::ksNext`
  - `Elektra::ksCurrent`
  - `Elektra::ksGetCursor`
  - `Elektra::ksSetCursor`
  - `KeySet::next`
  - `KeySet::current`
  - `KeySet::rewind`
  - `KeySet::getCursor`
  - `KeySet::setCursor`

  Until internal `KeySet` iterator support has been dropped form native library, `Elektra::ksRewind` is being retained while also being annotated as 'deprecated for removal'. The reason is, that we still need to rewind a `KeySet` before passing it to a native plugin via `NativePlugin::set`, `NativePlugin::get` or `NativePlugin::error`. _(Michael Tucek)_

  Furthermore `Elektra::ksPop` and `KeySet::pop` have been removed and `KeySet::remove` has been introduced as replacment.
  Until internal `KeySet` iterator support has been dropped form native library, `Elektra::ksRewind` is being retained while also being annotated as 'depricated for removal'. The reason is, that we still need to rewind a `KeySet` before passing it to a native plugin via `NativePlugin::set`, `NativePlugin::get` or `NativePlugin::error`. _(Michael Tucek)_

  Further more `Elektra::ksPop` and `KeySet::pop` have been removed and `KeySet::remove` has been introduced as replacment. _(Michael Tucek)_

- Renamed `KeyException` specializations: `KeyInvalidNameException`, `KeyTypeConversionException`, `KeyTypeMismatchException`

- Migration from Maven to Gradle _(Michael Tucek)_

- Updated documentation for usage of published artifacts _(Michael Tucek)_

- Integration of Maven Central publishing on Elektra release _(Robert Sowula)_

#### Outlook
