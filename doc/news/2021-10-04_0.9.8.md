- shortDesc: Redshift Elektrified, HL API & Java Binding Improvements

We are proud to release Elektra 0.9.8.

## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access
configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

You can also read the news [on our website](https://www.libelektra.org/news/0.9.8-release).

You can try out the latest Elektra release using our docker image [elektra/elektra](https://hub.docker.com/r/elektra/elektra).
This is the quickest way to get started with Elektra without compiling and other obstacles, simply run:

```sh
docker pull elektra/elektra
docker run -it elektra/elektra
```

## Highlights

- `kdb` now prohibits write operations on cascading keys that miss a corresponding existing key. See the details in the `Tools` section below and the new subsection on cascading writes in the [tutorial](/doc/tutorials/cascading.md) on cascading keys for further information. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- Redshift is now elektrified. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### Redshift and Elektra

We have created a version of [Redshift](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/) that uses Elektra for configuration management!

We removed and refactored Redshift's code for loading configuration files, parsing CLI options and validating configuration to use Elektra. Redshift with Elektra has about 700 fewer lines of code (-16%) and is a great example of what Elektra is all about: More applications with less code for configuration management!

To test it, take a look at our PR [Refactor to use Elektra ](https://github.com/jonls/redshift/pull/837) and follow the instructions provided in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/qwepoizt/redshift/blob/improve-config/elektrify/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Benefits of Redshift using Elektra

Refactoring Redshift to use Elektra brings the following benefits:

- Fewer lines of code: reduction of ~700 LOC or 16%
  (measured across all `*.c` and `*.h` files exclusive of files automatically generated by Elektra).
- Adding new configuration settings is easier and takes less time: Validation and parsing of setting values (from configuration file and CLI options) is handled by Elektra - no custom code required!
- Clean separation of application code and the specification of supported configuration settings (including defaults and validation rules).
- Automatic generation of CLI help text.

### HL API improvements

Redshift with Elektra uses the [high-level API](https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/high-level-api).

We have made a large number of improvements to the [high-level API](https://www.libelektra.org/tutorials/high-level-api) in the course of refactoring Redshift. The highlights are:

- Improved detection of differences in specification between an application's compilation and runtime.
- Improved validation of CLI options.
- Early detection of errors in specification files.
- Updated and improved documentation and tutorials.
- Various other bugfixes.

More improvements and details are explained in later sections of these release notes.

Thanks to _Klemens Böswirth_, _Markus Raab_ and _Tobias Schubert_!

### Windows releases

We are now shipping experimental releases for Windows 32- and 64-bit! They can be downloaded [here](https://build.libelektra.org/job/libelektra-release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/artifacts/).

A big success is that Redshift already works with Elektra under Windows.

## Plugins

The following section lists news about the [plugins](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme) we updated in this release.

### gopts

- The `gopts` plugin now includes deeply nested options and arguments in the generated help message. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Errors from `gopts` are now correctly reported. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- Fix wrong variable names in `gopts_win32.h`. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### range

- The `range` plugin now uses metakey `type` as fallback, if `check/type` is not specified. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- The `range` now treats all validation problems as warnings during kdbGet(). _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### spec

- The `spec` plugin now runs before other `postgetstorage` plugins, so that validation can happen during `kdbGet` as well.
  This is especially relevant in combination with `gopts`. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- Make spec plugin (with no support for # and \_ in key names) work in mingw-w64 builds. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### sync

- Add support for mingw-w64 builds using fflush. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### wresolver

- Add missing `ELEKTRA_PLUGIN_COMMIT` export. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### TOML

- Improvements to the parser, comment handling and especially quoting of strings. _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The `toml` plugin now supports all four kinds of strings via the `tomltype` metadata.
  The plugin also remembers which kind was used and handles escape sequences properly, instead of always
  converting to basic strings. For details take a look at the updated [README](../../src/plugins/toml/README.md) _(Klemens Böswirth)_
- The `comment/#/space` metakey is now used correctly to store the actual whitespace characters from the file,
  instead of a number. _(Klemens Böswirth)_

## Libraries

The text below summarizes updates to the [C (and C++)-based libraries](https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme) of Elektra.

### Compatibility

- Introduced public C API function `ksSearch`
- Previously public function `ksSearchInternal` is now static. Use `ksSearch` instead.

_(Michael Tucek)_

### Core

- Remove obsolete `ksNeedSync` function. _(Mihael Pranjić)_
- Replace various occurences of `sprintf` by `snprintf` and fix out of bounds array access in markdownlinkconverter. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### High-level API

- Modified High-level API to treat all warnings as errors. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Implemented support for warnings in High-level API error handling. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Fix a small bug for warnings in High-level API. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Fix resource management in High-level API error handling. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Implement a check to detect whether an application's specification was properly `mount`ed and `spec-mount`ed. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Implement a check to detect whether an application's specification was changed after installation. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Add sanity-checks to resource management. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Refactor and modularize code. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Update and improve inline documentation. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Remove "minimal validation" in favor of the new checks (see above). _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

### Ease

- Implement calculation of a specification token (=sha-256 hash). _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- Add [asmonier's sha-2](https://github.com/amosnier/sha-2) for sha-256 hash calculation. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_

## Bindings

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using [various programming languages](https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme). This section keeps
you up to date with the multi-language support provided by Elektra.

### Java binding

- Upgraded Java binding gradle wrapper to 7.2.
- Java source files are formatted using the [Google Java format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
- Renamed zero argument static factory method `Key::createNameless` to `Key::create`. To migrate to this change, just update calling code to use the new method name.
- Updated method documentation previously publishing the error key based error handling approach to the Java binding consumer. Such arguments are now explicitly only used for returning warning information in case no error occurred. In case of an exceptional state, appropriate exceptions are thrown. Such exceptions provide access to the underlying key containing warning and error information as meta data. Please review API usage to consider the more elaborated explanation of how Elektra uses this argument's value. Affected signatures:
  - Updated javadoc for `KDB::open(Key)`
  - Updated javadoc for `KDB::open(KeySet, Key)`
  - Updated javadoc for `KDB::close(Key)`
  - Updated javadoc for `KDB::get(Key)`
  - Updated javadoc for `KDB::get(KeySet, Key)`
  - Updated javadoc for `KDB::set(KeySet, Key)`, better explaining the relevance of the second argument `parentKey`
- Introduced `KeySet::remove(Key)` and `KeySet::remove(String)`
- Removed `KeySet::lookup(Key, int)` and `KeySet::lookup(String, int)` as well as accompanying flag definitions `KeySet::KDB_O_NONE`, `KeySet::KDB_O_DEL` and `KeySet::KDB_O_POP`. Please use `KeySet::lookup(Key)` and `KeySet::lookup(String)` instead. Instead of `KeySet::KDB_O_DEL`, please consider using `Key::release`. The proper replacement for `KeySet::KDB_O_POP` is `KeySet::remove(Key)` or `KeySet::remove(String)`.
- Native library proxy interface `Elektra` is now package private (previously was public).
- Added example Java plugin `whitelist` (see [here](../../src/bindings/jna/plugins/whitelist/README.md))
- Changed `Key nextMeta()` to `Optional<Key> nextMeta ()` no longer throwing NoSuchElementException for non-exceptional behavior
- Native library proxy interface `Elektra` is now package private (previously was public)
- Added example Java plugin `whitelist`
- Added support of binary valued keys:
  - Introduced `Key::getBinary()` and `Key::setBinary(byte[])`
  - Renamed `KeyBinaryTypeNotSupportedException` to `KeyStringValueException`
  - Introduced `KeyBinaryValueException`
  - Improved `Key` test coverage
- Fixed example project in `examples/external/java/read-keys-example`
  - now works with a standard installation of Elektra
  - updated code to work with current Java binding
- `KeySetReleasedException` and `KeyReleasedException` have been replaced by the native `IllegalStateException`
- Introduced abstraction `ReadableKey` to better reflect the limitations of meta data keys via a type hierarchy. Meta data keys are now returned as `ReadableKey`s:
  - `Key` extends `ReadableKey`
  - `Key` class is now final
  - Changed `Key Key::nextMeta()` to `Optional<ReadableKey> Key::nextMeta()`, no longer throwing NoSuchElementException for non-exceptional behavior
  - Changed `Key Key::currentMeta()` to `ReadableKey Key::currentMeta()`
  - Changed `Optional<Key> Key::getMeta(String)` to `Optional<ReadableKey> Key::getMeta(String)`
  - Meta data keys can no longer be manually released
  - Removed `Key::incRef`, `Key::decRef` and `Key::getRef`
  - `ReadableKey`/`Key` now implements `Comparable<ReadableKey>`
    - `int Key::cmp(Key)` has been renamed to `int Key::compareTo(Key)`
    - `ReadableKey` now implements `equals` and `hashCode` in line with the contract for `int Key::compareTo(Key)`
  - `ReadableKey`/`Key` no longer implements `Iterable<String>` for iterating over the parts of a key's name - use `Iterator<String> ReadableKey::keyNameIterator ()` instead
  - `Key` now implements `Iterable<Key>` to iterate over a key's meta data `ReadableKey`s
  - Fixed API method typo: Renamed `ReadableKey::isDirectBelow`/`Key::isDirectBelow` to `isDirectlyBelow`
- `KeyNameIterator` and `KeySetIterator` are now package private
- `KeySetAppendException` has been renamed to `KeySetException` and now conveys general `KeySet` related exceptional states
- `KeySet` now implements `SortedSet<Key>` (see [Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/SortedSet.html)). Previously `KeySet` was only implementing `Iterator<Key>`. Now a native key set can be used via its `KeySet` representation wherever one of the following Java Collection Framework interfaces is supported:
  - `Iterable`
  - `Collection`
  - `Set`
  - `SortedSet`

_(Michael Tucek)_

### GLib

- Compile `glib` binding with `-Wno-pedantic` for compatibility. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

## Tools

- Really add all tools when using `-DTOOLS=ALL`. _(Markus Raab)_
- ZeroMQ Hub: fix compilation and man page. _(Markus Raab)_
- Configure packaging for FUSE tool. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- FUSE: fix bug preventing binary writes. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- Ambiguous write operations are now disabled in kdb. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- `webd`: update npm dependencies. _(Mihael Pranjić)_

### KDB

- `kdb set`, `kdb meta-set`: Only allow writes to the cascading namespace if the lookup succeeds. Otherwise, the operation is ambiguous and therefore aborted.
  No more guessing of namespaces in case a cascading key is given (`user:, system`: for `kdb set`, `spec:` for `kdb meta-set`), _(Alexander Firbas)_
- `kdb set`, `kdb meta-set`: Validation of keys can no longer be bypassed by using non-cascading keys (except with the new --force (-f) option). _(Alexander Firbas)_
- Disable `-N/--namespace` option in all kdb subcommands _(Alexander Firbas)_
- Implement new name part getter commands `kdb namespace`, `kdb basename` and `kdb dirname`. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- `kdb file`: Remove namespace guessing (in case a cascading key is given, it needs to resolve to an existing key). _(Alexander Firbas)_
- `kdb editor/import`: Disable the use of cascading names (and the 'validate' strategy operating on cascading keys) entirely. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- Update numerous tests to comply with changes above. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- Add a new subsection on cascading writes to the [tutorial](/doc/tutorials/cascading.md) on cascading keys. _(Alexander Firbas)_
- `kdb gen`: Generate specification token during code-generation and add it to generated contract. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- `kdb gen`: Improve naming of variables to make code easier to understand. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
- `kdb spec-mount`: Improve usability by failing with helpful error messages, if the specification contains errors. _(Tobias Schubert @qwepoizt)_
