# Who uses Elektra?

Elektra has three different main targets.

## Desktop

Elektra allows applications to read and write from a global
configuration tree. We miss a specification (schema) so that these
configuration values can be shared (integrated).

- [KDE](https://kde.org) (in progress)
- [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) (in progress)

## Embedded

Elektra is on the frontier for embedded systems because of
its tiny core and the many possibilities with its plugins.

Known users:

- OpenWRT (distribution)
- Broadcom (blue-ray devices)
- Kapsch (cameras)
- Toshiba (TVs)

## Server

Elektra is ideal suited for a local configuration storage by
mounting existing configuration files into the global tree. Nodes
using Elektra can be connected by already existing configuration
management tools.

Known users:

- Allianz
- TU Wien
