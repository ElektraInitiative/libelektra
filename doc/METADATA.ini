[needs/#]
type= string
status= proposed
description= hint of application developer that the key actually needs
  a specific plugin (that cannot be derived by other metadata)
  "needs" means that it is semantically absolutely necessary and
  required that such an plugin exists.
  Without the plugin the application might break.
  If the plugin is optional and only nice to have, use recommends
  instead.
example=
  needs/#0=augeas
  needs/#1=validation
note=  It is generally preferred that other metadata will be used to
  deduce the needs of the specification, e.g. use check/validation
  meta data instead of as given above.

[config/needs/#/_]
type= string
status= proposed
description= Arbitrary metakeys that indicate that the key needs some
  configuration for plugins in order to work.
example=
  config/needs/#0/lenses=path/to/lenses.aug
  config/needs/#1/script=path/to/script.py
note=
  1.) The config will be given to the user-part of the plugin
      referred to.
  2.) It is not possible for meta keys to have meta data.
      So currently you cannot configure e.g. a glob plugin this way.
      This is not necessary anyway, because every meta data defined
      in the specification can be retrieved by the user through
      the spec/ hierarchy.

[config/_]
type= string
status= proposed
description= Arbitrary metakeys that indicate that the key needs some
  plugin configuration in order to work.
  This configuration will be written to the system/ part and will be
  available for all plugins.
note= Avoid this feature and use other metadata instead.

[recommends/#]
type= string
status= proposed
description= Key recommends a plugin for further features.
  The semantics are still well-defined if the plugin is absent.
note= Avoid this feature and use other metadata instead.


#
# Important meta-data often used in configuration files
# (and seldom in specifications)
#

[order]
type= int
status= implemented
plugin= hosts augeas keytometa
description= relative order in the keyset if non-alphabetical order
  is needed. This meta data is only to preserve order as found in
  the file. It is an hint to allow complete reconstruction as it
  was before.
  Keys without order meta data or keys with same order, yield
  implementation-defined ordering.
  When some knowledge about desired ordering exists, e.g. when
  key sets are merged, the keys should to be reordered to avoid
  this.
note= this will rarely used within specifications, but is directly
  derived from configuration files.

[comment]
type= string
status= implemented
plugin= hosts (keytometa)
description= the users comment about the key (mostly its value)
  (TODO CHECK)
  the first line is the comment after a key=value
  further lines are the lines before a key=value
note= this will rarely used within specifications, but rather directly
  in configuration files.

[check/type]
type= string
status= implemented
plugin= type
description= defines the type of the value, as specified in CORBA.

[check/type/min]
type= int
status= implemented
plugin= type
description= defines the min value type of the integer value

[check/type/max]
type= int
status= implemented
plugin= type
description= defines the max value type of the integer value

[check/format]
type= string
status= idea
description= defines the format of the value

[check/path]
status= implemented
plugin= path
description= defines which file (path) the value referes to

[check/validation]
status= implemented
plugin= validation
type= regular expression
description= a regular expression to check against

[check/validation/message]
status= implemented
plugin= validation
description= a message added to warning if validation fails

[check/range]

description= range checks, from-to, or arbitrary sets of numbers
see= check/type/min and check/type/max for already existing
  implementations

[deprecated]
status= idea
description= Flag keys that will be removed in further versions
note= thanks to Config==Model for that idea

[shareable]
status= idea
description= Flag keys that should not be exported

[source]
status= idea
description= states where a key comes from if it is not from an ordinary
 persistent configuration. E.g.= hardware (queries)
 e.g. system/sw/xorg/current/monitor might have "source" metadata if it
 is queried from hardware and not from configuration file.

[dependency/control]
status= idea
description= control keys which enable/disable parameters

[dependency/value]
status= idea
description= specific values of the dependency key have impact on that key

[application/name]
status= idea
description= links a key to a application, so that it can be easily purged
 when the application is no longer installed.
 Note that this is only needed together with another option below like version.
 Typically purged keys can be found easily when no schema for it exists anymore.

[application/version]
status= idea
description= links a key to a specific set of version(s). Can be used to control
 purging even more specific

[restrict/write]
status= idea
description= avoid writing on the value of the key, it still can be removed

[restrict/remove]
status= idea
description= avoid removal of key (needs schema-checker to read key)

[final]
status= idea
plugin= merger
description= do not allow the key to be overwritten by a merger plugin

[evaluate/<language>]
type= program code
status= idea
plugin= evaluater
description= evaluate expression to check if key should be included, program should
 abort or however evalute plugin is configured

[uid]
status= currently obsolete
type= time
description= The owner of the key.

[gid]
status= currently obsolete
type= time
description= The group of the key.

[mode]
status= currently obsolete
type= int
description= The access mode of the key.

[atime]
type= time
status= currently obsolete
description= The time when the key was last accessed.

[mtime]
type= time
status= currently obsolete
description= The time when the value of a key were last modified.

[ctime]
type= time
status= currently obsolete
description= The time when the meta data of a key were last modified.

#
# Information about formatting
#

# 
# Currently there is no uniform way to handle the formatting of a Keys in
# the written configuration file. This leads to lost or incorrect formatting
# which can be annoying for the user. This section aims to establish 
# several metakeys that control the handling of Key formatting
#

key: formatting/blanklinesbefore
status: idea
description: number of blank lines to insert before
  the key is written to the configuration file

key: formatting/blanklinesafter
status: idea
description: number of blank lines to insert after
  the key is written to the configuration file
note: both keys may be needed although they partly overlap
  blanklinesafter is needed for the last key in the configuration file
  because no following key can use blanklinesbefore instead
  blanklinesbefore is needed for the first key in the configuration file
  because no preceeding key can use blanklinesafter instead
  However, there should be a preference of what to use if both
  is applicable
