#
# SpecElektra is a specification language that describes content
# of KDB (the global key database).
#
# Put simply, SpecElektra (i.e. configuration in the spec: namespace)
# allows you to describe how the configuration of the system looks
# like. For example, it allows you to describe which configuration
# files in which formats are present on the system.
#
# SpecElektra does not have built-in keywords, instead it is
# completely extensible by metadata interpreted by Elektra's plugins.
#
# Any of Elektra's supported configuration formats that are able
# to write metadata can be used for SpecElektra.
#


#
# This document describes all metadata and specification values available
# in SpecElektra.
#
# If your plugin/tool/API uses metadata, please add it here.
#
# Some parts of this file are already used by tools:
#
# 1. It can be mounted with the ni plugin, see scripts/mount-info
# 2. It is checked for consistency with contracts of plugins, see
#    tests/shell/check_meta.sh
#

#
# METADATA.ini meta-specification (description how to parse/use this file):
#
# [the name of the metakey]
# type = (<CORBA type>|enum <enum>|regex <regular expression>) the type of the metavalue
# status = (implemented|proposed|idea|deprecated|unclear) the current state of this metadata entry
# usedby/api = the API methods which use the metakey (space separated)
# usedby/plugin = the plugins which use the metakey (space separated)
# usedby/tool = the tools which use the metakey (space separated)
# description = explains what the metadata is about
# note = give additional notes for that metakey
# example = give additional examples how the metakey might look like
#
# Nearly all of the metadata is automatically used by `spec-mount` thus
# `spec-mount` is not listed in usedby/tool.
#
#
#
# To mount this file you can use:
#
#  kdb mount-info
#
# and keys will be below:
#
#  kdb export system:/info/elektra/metadata/#0
#
# for example, to get the type of type:
#
#  kdb meta-get system:/info/elektra/metadata/#0/type type
#
# Note that the ni plugin does not preserve comments nor order,
# so it is not suitable to write to this file.

	- The topmost comment belonging to the key is (#1).

	Comment keys that are not above any key (comments in the last
	lines of files) are added to the parentkey.

	The array of comments allows:

	- to structure comments, which are not line-based
	- to restore formatting, including:
	 - inline comments
	 - spaces before comments
	 - empty lines
	- to distinguish between different kinds of comments
	- to tag every comment, which increases extensibility

	The plugin need to take care that only valid characters are

	- important: setting has no reasonable default and most likely will fail, should be set so that application is (more) useful. (e.g. website URL to serve, relay host for mail relay)
	- user: often has reasonable default but most users would like to see it
	- advanced: settings most users do not want to see (e.g. related to resource usage) or to enable experimental features or where defaults usually work
	- developer: settings only relevant for developers of the application
	- internal: settings which should not be seen by anyone. (e.g. intermediate steps for calculations)"
