#
# SpecElektra is a specification language that describes content
# of the global key database.
#
# SpecElektra does not have built-in keywords, instead it is
# completely extensible by metadata interpreted by Elektra's plugins.
#
# Any of Elektra's supported configuration formats that are able
# to write metadata can be used for SpecElektra.
#


#
# This document describes all metadata and specification values available
# in SpecElektra.
#
# If your plugin/tool/API uses metadata, please add it here.
#

#
# metameta (description how to parse/use this file)
#
# [the name of the metakey]
# type= (string|enumeration|regular expression) the type of the metavalue
# status= (implemented|proposed|idea|deprecated|unclear) the current state of this metadata entry, deprecated means it is implemented but use is not recommended
# usedby/api= the API methods which use the metakey (space separated)
# usedby/plugin= the plugins which use the metakey (space separated)
# usedby/tool= the tools which use the metakey (space separated)
# description= explains what it is about
# note= give additional notes for that metakey
# example= give additional examples how the metakey might look like
#
# To mount this file you can use:
#
#  kdb mount /path/to/doc/METADATA.ini system/metadata ni
#
# To get a metavalue, use:
#
#  kdb getmeta system/metadata/ni version/major
#  kdb getmeta system/metadata/ni version/minor
#  kdb getmeta system/metadata/order type

# Important metadata often used in configuration files
# (and seldom in specifications)
#

[order]
type= int
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= hosts augeas ini
usedby/api= elektraKeyCmpOrder
description= relative order in the keyset if non-alphabetical order
	is needed. This metadata is only to preserve order as found in
	the file. It is an hint to allow complete reconstruction as it
	was before.
	Keys without order metadata or keys with same order, yield
	implementation-defined ordering.
	When some knowledge about desired ordering exists, e.g. when
	key sets are merged, the keys should to be reordered to avoid
	this.
note= this will rarely used within specifications, but is directly
	derived from configuration files.
	I.e. only storage plugins set and get this property.

[comment]
type= string
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= (keytometa)
description= the users comment about the key (mostly its value)
	the first line is the comment after a key/value
	further lines are the lines before a key/value
note= this will rarely used within specifications, but rather directly
	in configuration files.




[line]
type= int
status= proposal
description= contains the line number from which a key was read.
note= is useful for validation problems when someone directly
	edits files



#
# Needed for specification of key access (ksLookup by spec)
#

[fallback/#]
type=key name
status=implemented
usedby/api= ksLookup
description=When a key was looked up unsuccessfully, keys in this
	array will be tried instead.

[override/#]
type=key name
usedby/api= ksLookup
status=implemented
description=Keys in this array will be preferred over the key
	itself

[namespace/#]
type=namespace
status=implemented
usedby/api= ksLookup
description=Typically all namespaces are cascaded one after the other
	in the build-in order.
	Using this metadata you can avoid that some namespaces are used or
	can change the order.

[default]
status=implemented
usedby/api= ksLookup
description=The default value will be used if no other value could
	be found successfully.




[context]
status=implemented

	a context-aware lookup

#

[binary]
type=empty
status=implemented
usedby/api= keyNew keyVNew keyIsBinary keyIsString keyValue keyGetValueSize keyString keyGetString keySetString keyGetBinary keySetBinary
usedby/plugin= null
description= For this metadata only the presence is significant, not its value.
	It is used to tag binary keys. Binary keys are keys that either have no value (null keys, keyValue returns null).


[array]
type = array-index
status = proposed
description = Such keys have only keys conforming to Elektraâ€™s arrays convention as subkeys.
	If the metavalue is empty, the array is empty (no subkeys).
	Otherwise the metavalue contains the last element.
example = #5





#
# Needed for mounting by specification
#

[mountpoint]
type=string
status= implemented
usedby/tool= mount-spec
description=indicates that the key represents a mountpoint

	the value is the filename that should be used for the configuration file
	defined by the specification
example=default.ecf


[infos]
type= string
status= implemented
usedby/tool= mount-spec
description= infos about the mountpoint

	See CONTRACT.ini for individual infos (usedby is tagged with spec).

	hint of application developer that the key actually needs
	a specific plugin (that cannot be derived by other metadata)
	"needs" means that it is semantically absolutely necessary and
	required that such an plugin exists.

	Without the plugin the application might break.
	If the plugin is optional and only nice to have, use recommends
	instead.
note=  It is generally preferred that other metadata will be used to
	deduce the needs of the specification, e.g. use check/validation
	metadata instead of as given above.

[config]
type= string
status= proposed
description= indicate that the mountpoint needs some
	configuration for plugins in order to work.

	See CONTRACT.ini for details.

	The example is only for documentation unlike the default
	which will be used if nothing else is given.

# The following proposal may supersede/complement the previous comment,
# because it allows:
# - to restore formatting, including:
#  - inline comments
#  - spaces before comments
#  - empty lines
# - to distinguish between different kinds of comments and empty lines
# - to tag every single comment line, which increases extensibility
#
# It needs, however, an API so that the user is not required to fiddle
# with all these details.

[comment/#]
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= hosts

description= comment line preceding an actual key
	Except #0, which is the inline key (in the same line).
	The comment numbering starts from top to bottom. The comment
	directly above the key is the last entry in the array and
	the topmost comment belonging to the key is #1.
	Comment keys that are not above any key (comments in the last
	lines of files) are added to the parentkey.
