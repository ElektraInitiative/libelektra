#
# SpecElektra is a specification language that describes content
# of the global key database.
#
# Put simply, SpecElektra (configuration in the spec namespace)
# allows you to describe how the configuration of the system looks
# like. For example, it allows you to describe which configuration
# files in which formats are present on the system.
#
# SpecElektra does not have built-in keywords, instead it is
# completely extensible by metadata interpreted by Elektra's plugins.
#
# Any of Elektra's supported configuration formats that are able
# to write metadata can be used for SpecElektra.
#


#
# This document describes all metadata and specification values available
# in SpecElektra.
#
# If your plugin/tool/API uses metadata, please add it here.
#
# Some parts of this file are already used by tools
#
# 1. It can be mounted with the ni and ini plugin, see scripts/mount-info and below
# 2. It is checked for consistency with contracts of plugins, see
#    tests/shell/check_meta.sh
#

#
# METADATA.ini meta-specification (description how to parse/use this file):
#
# [the name of the metakey]
# type= (<CORBA type>|enum <enum>|regex <regular expression>) the type of the metavalue
# status= (implemented|proposed|idea|deprecated|unclear) the current state of this metadata entry
# usedby/api= the API methods which use the metakey (space separated)
# usedby/plugin= the plugins which use the metakey (space separated)
# usedby/tool= the tools which use the metakey (space separated)
# description= explains what the metadata is about
# note= give additional notes for that metakey
# example= give additional examples how the metakey might look like
#
# Nearly all of the metadata is automatically used by `spec-mount` thus
# `spec-mount` is not listed in usedby/tool.

# Important metadata often used in configuration files
# (and seldom in specifications)
#

[order]
type= int
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= hosts augeas ini
usedby/api= elektraKeyCmpOrder
description= relative order in the keyset if non-alphabetical order
	is needed. This metadata is only to preserve order as found in
	the file. It is an hint to allow complete reconstruction as it
	was before.
	Keys without order metadata or keys with same order, yield
	implementation-defined ordering.
	When some knowledge about desired ordering exists, e.g. when
	key sets are merged, the keys should to be reordered to avoid
	this.
note= this will rarely used within specifications, but is directly
	derived from configuration files.
	I.e. only storage plugins set and get this property.

[comment]
type= string
status= deprecated
usedby/plugin= keytometa
description= the users comment about the key (mostly its value)
	the first line is the comment after a key-value (in the same line)
	further lines are the lines before a key-value

	This metadata is deprecated because it assumes line-based comments
	and cannot preserve formatting within comments.
note= if used within specifications it refers to the specification, not
	the key. Use `description` to refer to the key.

[comment/#]
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= hosts
type= string
description= A comment preceding or in-line with a key.

	- #0 is the inline comment (in the same line).
	- The comment numbering starts from top (#1) to bottom (#n).
	- The comment directly above the key is the last entry in the array (#n).
	- The topmost comment belonging to the key is (#1).

	Comment keys that are not above any key (comments in the last
	lines of files) are added to the parentkey.

	The array of comments allows:

	- to structure comments, which are not line-based
	- to restore formatting, including:
	 - inline comments
	 - spaces before comments
	 - empty lines
	- to distinguish between different kinds of comments
	- to tag every comment, which increases extensibility

	The plugin need to take care that only valid characters are
	present in the comment.
	E.g. on line-based comments, no newlines must be present.
note= if used within specifications it refers to the specification, not
	the key. Use `description` to refer to the key.

[comment/#/start]
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= hosts
type= string
description= Determines the character(s) used to start this comment.

	This metakey is empty if its an empty line/comment.

	The default on absence of this key is plugin-specific.
	Some comment start character should be assumed then.

	The plugin needs to make sure that every comment is actually
	commented out. An error needs to be emitted if there is no
	start symbol that will be recognized as comment.
example= ;

[comment/#/space]
status= implemented
usedby/plugin= hosts
type= string
description= The spaces/tabs used between a comment and the beginning of the
	line or after end of payload data (for inline comments).

	If no start key is present, only space and no comment is present.

	The plugin needs to make sure that all spaces present are allowed.
	An error needs to be emitted if non-ignored spaces are present.
example=




[line]

description= infos about the mount point

	See CONTRACT.ini for individual infos (usedby is tagged with spec).

	hint of application developer that the key actually needs
	a specific plugin (that cannot be derived by other metadata)
	"needs" means that it is semantically absolutely necessary and
	required that such an plugin exists.

	Without the plugin the application might break.
	If the plugin is optional and only nice to have, use recommends
	instead.
note=  It is generally preferred that other metadata will be used to
	deduce the needs of the specification, e.g. use check/validation
	metadata instead of as given above.

[config]
type= string
status= proposed
description= indicate that the mount point needs some
	configuration for plugins in order to work.

usedby/plugin= (ini)
description= Internal metadata to be ignored by other plugins.
example=internal/ini/parent could be the name for internal parent
	information of the ini plugin.

[source]
status= idea
description= states where a key comes from if it is not from an ordinary
	persistent configuration. E.g. hardware (queries)
	e.g. system/sw/xorg/current/monitor might have "source" metadata if it
	is queried from hardware and not from configuration file.

[dependency/control]
status= idea
description= control keys which enable/disable parameters

[dependency/value]
status= idea
description= specific values of the dependency key have impact on that key

[application/name]
status= idea
description= links a key to an application, so that it can be easily purged
	when the application is no longer installed.
	Note that this is only needed together with another option below like version.
	Typically purged keys can be found easily when no schema for it exists anymore.

[application/version]
status= idea
description= links a key to a specific set of version(s). Can be used to control
	purging even more specific

[fixed]
status= idea
description= The key will return the given value in any case.

[restrict/write]
status= idea
usedby/tool = web
description= avoid writing on the value of the key, it still can be removed

[restrict/binary]
status= idea
usedby/tool = web
description= binary keys are not allowed

[restrict/remove]
status= idea
usedby/tool = web
description= avoid removal of key (needs schema-checker to read key)

[evaluate/<language>]
type= program code
status= idea
description= evaluate expression to check if key should be included, program should
	abort or however evaluate plugin is configured


[accessibility]
status= idea
description= who is allowed to edit this configuration setting?


[visibility]
status= implemented
usedby/tool = web
type= enum
	critical
	important
	user
	advanced
	developer
	internal
description= who should see this configuration setting?
	This is the equivalent of priority in debconf.
	If no visibility is given, "user" is assumed.

	The meaning is:
	- critical: setting must be changed, otherwise the system/application will fail. (e.g. boot device, hostname)
	- important: setting has no reasonable default and most likely will fail, should be set so that application is (more) useful. (e.g. website URL to serve, relay host for mail relay)
	- user: often has reasonable default but most users would like to see it
	- advanced: settings most users do not want to see (e.g. related to resource usage) or to enable experimental features or where defaults usually work
	- developer: settings only relevant for developers of the application
	- internal: settings which should not be seen by anyone. (e.g. intermediate steps for calculations)

[check/unit]
type= empty
status = implemented

[spec]
description= to not avoid metakeys with standard spec keys, no metakey name must begin with spec

description= to not avoid metakeys with standard proc keys, no metakey name must begin with proc

[dir]
description= to not avoid metakeys with standard dir keys, no metakey name must begin with dir

# Plugin specific Metadata
#

[crypto/encrypt]
status= implemented
usedby/plugins= crypto
type= string
description= used to mark a key for encryption. The crypto plugin is supposed to encrypt the key. After the encryption the type of the key will be set to "binary". Its original type will be restored after decryption.

[crypto/salt]
status= implemented
usedby/plugins= crypto
type= string
description= used to store the salt that seeds the Key Derivation Function, which is used for deriving the cryptographic key and the initialization vector (IV).
	The salt is re-generated on every encryption call (called by kdb set) so no key and IV combination is ever used twice.
	No special protection is required for the salt. It can be persisted as plain text.

[gpg/binary]
status= implemented
usedby/plugins= gpgme
type= string
description= used to mark a key that contained a binary value before encryption.

[xerces/rootname]
status= implemented
usedby/plugins= xerces
type= string
description= used to store the name of the xml file's original root element when mounting to a mount point which name doesn't correspond to the xml root element.
	This metadata will be stored in the mount point key. When writing or exporting again, the stored name will be used for the root element of the corresponding xml document.

[unit/base]
type = dec hex
default = dec
usedby/plugins = hexnumber
description = used to specify the base of an integer value. Currently only the hexnumber plugin supports this metadata. It converts any value marked as "hex" from
	hexadecimal into decimal when the configuration is read, and back when it is written. The hexnumber plugin also ensures that a value marked as "hex" starts with "0x" or "0X".

[origvalue]
status = implemented
type = string
usedby/plugins = type boolean
description = used by plugins that normalize and restore key values for storing the original key value. Plugins should ALWAYS use this metakey. This key will be cleared on keySetString,
	so if it is present, the key is unchanged and should be restored. Plugins should NEVER overwrite or remove this metakey, if it is present, because this may break other plugins. If a
	plugins needs to normalize a value, but 'origvalue' is already set, an error should be produced, because to plugins cannot be responsible for normalizing the same keys.

[check/boolean/true]
status = implemented
type = string
usedby/plugins = type
description = overrides the allowed true value for this key. Only the given value or 1 will be allowed as true. All true keys will be restored to this value in `kdbSet`.
	Must be used together with check/boolean/false.

[check/boolean/false]
status = implemented
type = string
usedby/plugins = type
description = overrides the allowed false value for this key. Only the given value or 0 will be allowed as false. All false keys will be restored to this value in `kdbSet`.
	Must be used together with check/boolean/true.

[cache/clear]
status = implemented
usedby/plugins = cache
type = boolean
description = tells the cache plugin to remove all cache files during the next `kdbGet` in a safe way.

[tomltype]
status = implemented
usedby/plugins = toml
type = enum
	simpletable
	tablearray
	inlinetable
descriptions = Tells the TOML plugin, which kind of TOML structure a key represents. When reading a TOML file, the plugin sets this metakey when encountering a TOML structure.
	On writing, it is used for writing the structure back into a TOML file.
	No metakey inference is done on writing, it's either set by a previous read of a TOML file or set explicitly by the user.
