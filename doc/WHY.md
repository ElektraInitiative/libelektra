# Why Should I use Elektra?

The three main points relevant for most people are:

1. Even though Elektra provides a global key database,
   that allows _read- and write access_ of every single
   parameter _for any application_ in an integrated fashion,
   configuration files stay human read- and writable.
2. Flexible adoption on how the configuration settings are accessed
   via plugins: you can run arbitrary code in multiple
   languages or notify others when configuration files
   are changed. [Plugins](/src/plugins) allow us to
   support hundreds of different configuration file
   formats.
3. Elektra allows us to specify configuration values:
   - use the value of other configuration values (symbolic links)
   - calculate the values based on other configuration values
   - [validate configuration files](/doc/tutorials/validation.md)
   - [generate code based on specifications](../src/tools/pythongen)
   - [and much more](/src/plugins/README.md)

## Why not Other Solutions?

Some might ask: isn't this solution overkill?
Why not tackle these three issues separately?
The answer is:

1. If we would only implement a configuration file library for
   applications, we would hinder the work of administrators and
   would not provide **external access** to configuration
   settings or specifications.
2. If we only implement an administrator tool that can parse
   and generate configuration files, but is not used by the
   applications themselves, we create a gap that leads to
   inconsistent understanding of the configuration file **syntax**.
3. If we only specify the meaning of configuration settings within
   applications but not in a form accessible for administrators,
   we would create a gap that leads to inconsistent understanding
   of the configuration settings' **semantics**.

For common understanding of syntax and semantics of configuration files
a full-stack solution like Elektra is required. We acknowledge, however,
that such a change cannot be done overnight, thus we integrate as many
configuration file formats as possible. This way, people can continue
using files in `/etc`, regardless of whether or not Elektra is used.

To give one example, in OpenLDAP 2.4.39 the value of `listener-threads`
will be reduced to the next number that is a power of 2. To correctly
manipulate the setting we need not only know the _syntax_ of how to write
listener-threads correctly in the configuration file, but also the
knowledge how the value is transformed internally. Elektra solves all
three issues, and then users can easily **externally** manipulate
`listener-threads`, without caring about the concrete **syntax** of the
file and getting feedback of the **semantics** (you might get validation
errors and you can receive the value exactly as the application will get it).

## Unique Features

Features that rarely can be found elsewhere (at least in this combination):

- Bootstrap code and proper abstraction is included:
  - You do not need to worry about the file names of configuration files
    in the application.
  - Cascading between `/etc`, `$HOME`, `cwd` and so on.
  - You can change which Elektra path is connected to which configuration
    file with [mounting](/doc/help/elektra-mounting.md).
  - Portable across OS (Linux, BSD, w64, macOS,.. ) and desktop systems (GNOME, KDE,...).
- No daemon, so no single point of failure but still having guarantees of consistent,
  validated files with good performance.
- Provides 3-way merging for configuration upgrades.

## Further Reasons

- Links and automatic calculation of values:
  unlike with other solutions you do not need to duplicate
  configuration values for different applications but
  you can comfortably link between them which makes
  many inconsistencies impossible.
- Allows us to easily create GUIs and web-UIs for the whole configuration settings
  on the system.
- Allows you to import/export all parts of the configuration settings.
- Syntax independence: you can consistently use your favorite syntax.
- Configuration Management (such as Puppet) can be used on top of it
  without having to fiddle with specifics of every configuration file.
- CLI-tool available
- `kdb editor` allows you to edit any path of Elektra with your favorite
  syntax (independent of the actual syntax of the configuration files
  that store values of this path).
- Allows us to also [integrate command-line arguments and environment](/src/bindings/intercept/env)
  into a consistent place for configuration.
- Reduces huge amount of code: Nearly every application has very similar code:
  - finding the correct configuration file (for different OS)
  - parsing configuration files
  - validating configuration files
  - replace configuration files on changes
- All advantages libraries have:
  - Performance: Improvements in the library benefits all applications.
  - The library only needs to be loaded once in the memory.
  - On fixes not all binaries of all applications need to be replaced.
- All advantages maintained code with a community has:
  - If something does not work, open an issue.
  - If you have a question, open an issue.
  - Regular releases.
