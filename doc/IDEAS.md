# Ideas for Contributing to Elektra

This page is the first point for anyone interested in contributing to Elektra!


## How can I get started?

We prepared
[good first issues](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
for you.

- We encourage you to improve documentation.
- In the source code, you should look into [libs](/src/libs/) and [plugins](/src/plugins/).
- You can always peek into the [TODOs](/doc/todo), if you don't know what to do.
- An ideal project is to elektrify some free software.

Elektrify means:

- Patch the application so that it uses Elektra as its configuration system.
- Write a specification that describes how the configuration of the application
  looks like.

If you are interested in directly improving Elektra, other projects might be of
more interest to you:

- Further configuration file formats could be supported.
- The qt-gui could be improved.
- Your own ideas?
