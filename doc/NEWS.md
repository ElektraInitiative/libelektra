# 0.8.13 Release

Still under construction, 0.8.13 is not yet released.


## elektrify-getenv

getenv(3) is one of the most popular ways to retrieve configuration,
even though it has many known problems:
- no standard way to modify it
- relogin (or restart of shell) necessary
- names are flat (no hierarchical structure)
- cannot be set for individual applications
- not available in at, cron and similar scripts

With elektrify-getenv we wrote a solution which solves most of the
problems. We use the LD_PRELOAD technique to additionally retrieve
values from Elektra, and not only the environment.


...

So is this the final solution for configuration and manual elektrification
of applications is not needed anymore?

The answer is: no and yes.

It is quite satisfactory for configuration that is inherently sharable
(not different from one application to another) *and* needs the environment
semantics, i.e. some subprocesses should have different configuration
than others, e.g. in a specific terminal.

But it might not be a good solution for your own application, because
libgetenv(3) implies many architectural decision, that other elektrified
applications would decide differently, e.g.:
- it uses global variables (getenv(3) has no handle)
- it uses mutex for multi-threading safety
- the API getenv(3) only returns `char*` and has no support for other data types









## Packaging

https://packages.qa.debian.org/e/elektra/news/20150726T155000Z.html
- 0.8.12 packaged+migrated to testing, thanks to Pino Toscano <pino@debian.org>

- According to [issue #262](libelektra.org/issues/262), we plan to remove the option ENABLE_CXX11
  If you have any system you are not able to build Elektra with -DENABLE_CXX11=ON (which is
  the default for 0.8.12) please report that immediately.

## Goals

prefer simplicity to flexibility! (GOALS)
	use it also for normal plugins (pre, postfilter)
more "pythonic way", there should be one way to do it
but every way is optional, if you want you can use it, otherwise you can leave it out:
- as primitive key/value storage
- with specification
- with code generation
- ...

but no flexibility regarding:
- namespaces are only useful for configuration (not for arbitrary key/value)
- mounting and contracts functionality
- error code meanings are fixed, if a resolver detects a conflict, error #30 must be used
- of course ABI, API

- XDG resolver: handle XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, where no path is valid, correctly


## qt-gui 0.0.8

- made sure keys can only be renamed if the new name/value/metadata is different from the existing ones
- fixed 1) and 2) of #233
- fixed #235, is the current situation with duplication ok (in Confignode::setName() etc) or should this be changed?
- fixed qml warning when deleting key

## escaped key names
- keyUnescapedName has been added to our main API (moved from proposal)
- additional most of our bindings have been modified to allow easy iterations over key names. To see how the iterator works in the individual language check out their examples.

## other fixes

- Key::release() and Key::~Key will also work when Key holds a null-pointer
- Key::getName(), avoid std::string exception




# 0.8.12 Release

- guid: 98770541-32a1-486a-98a1-d02f26afc81a
- author: Markus Raab
- pubDate: Sun, 12 Jul 2015 20:14:09 +0200

Again we managed to release with new features, many build system
fixes and also other improvements.

## dir namespace

This namespace adds per-project or per-directory (hence the name) configurations.
E.g. think how git works: not only /etc and ~ are relevant sources
for configuration but also the nearest .git directory.

This technique is, however, much more widely useful than just for git
repositories! Nearly every application can benefit from such a per-dir
configuration. Its almost certain that you have already run into the
problem that different projects have different guidelines
(e.g. coding conventions, languages, whitespace requirements, line breaks, ..).
Obviously, thats not a per-user configuration and
its also not a per-file issue (thats how its usually solved today).
So in fact you want, e.g., your editor to have an additional per-project layer
to choose between such settings.

The technique is useful for nearly every other tool:
- different color palettes in gimp, inkscape,..
- different languages for libreoffice
- different security settings for media players, interpreters (e.g. when in Download folder)
- per-folder .htaccess in apache or other web servers
- any other per-dir configuration you can imagine..

It is simple to use, also for the administrative side. First, change to the folder to your
folder (e.g. where a project is):

    cd ~/projects/abc

Then add some user (or system or spec) configuration to have some default.

    kdb set user/sw/editor/textwidth 72

Then verify that we get this value back when we do a cascading lookup:

    kdb get /sw/editor/textwidth

The default configuration file for the dir-namespace is `pwd`/KDB_DB_DIR/filename:

    kdb file dir/sw/editor/textwidth

- KDB_DB_DIR can be modified at compile-time and is `.dir` per default
- filename can be modified by mounting, see below, and is `default.ecf` by default

We assume, that the project abc has the policy to use textwidth 120, so
we change the dir-configuration:

    kdb set dir/sw/editor/textwidth 120

Now we will get the value 120 in the folder ~/projects/abc and its
subdirectories (!), but everywhere else we still get 72:

    kdb get /sw/editor/textwidth

Obviously, that does not only work with kdb, but with every elektrified tool.


### mount files in dir namespaces

For cascading mountpoints, the dir name is also automatically mounted, e.g.:

    kdb mount editor.ini /sw/editor ini

But its also possible to only mount for the namespace dir if no cascading mountpoint is
present already:

    kdb mount app.ini dir/sw/app tcl

In both cases keys below dir/sw/editor would be in the INI file
`.dir/editor.ini` and not in the file `.dir/default.ecf`.


### dir together with spec namespace

In the project P we had the following issue: We needed on a specific computer the
configuration in /etc to be used in favour of the dir config.

We could easily solve the problem using the specification:

    kdb setmeta spec/sw/P/current/org/base override/#0 /sw/P/override/org/base


Hence, we could create system/sw/P/override/org/base which would be in favour of dir/sw/P/current/org/base.
So we get system/sw/P/override/org/base when we do:

    kdb get /sw/P/current/org/base

Alternatively, one could also use the specification:

    kdb setmeta spec/sw/P/current/org/base namespace/#0 user
    kdb setmeta spec/sw/P/current/org/base namespace/#1 system
    kdb setmeta spec/sw/P/current/org/base namespace/#2 dir

Which makes dir the namespace with the least priority and system would be preferred.
This was less suitable for our purpose, because we needed the override
only on one computer. For all other computers we wanted dir
to be preferred with only one specification.


### Conclusion

The great thing is, that every elektrified application, automatically gets all the mentioned features.
Not even a recompilation of the application is necessary.

Especially the specification provides flexibility not present in other configuration systems.


## Qt-Gui 0.0.7

Raffael Pancheri again did a lot of stabilizing work:
- show errormessage on exception when starting gui
- Correctly update keyAreaView property when selecting item in TreeView
- Fix crash when creating key in MountingWizard
- Remove information on successful export
- Show error dialog on failed import
- Remove namefilters (every syntax can have any file extension)
- other namespaces (including dir) are included

The GUI can be handy for many purposes, e.g. we use it already as xml and json editor.
Note that there are still [some bugs](http://git.libelektra.org/issues).

## Compatibility

As always, the API and API is fully compatible. Because nothing was added, its even
possible to link against an older version of Elektra (if compiled against 0.8.12).

In plugins some small changes may effect compatibility:
- in rename the handling of parent key is different (see #206)
- resolving of spec absolute and relative pathes are no more handled identical.
  Instead absolute pathes will be searched absolutely, while relatives are below KDB_DB_SPEC (as before).
  This behaviour is consistent to the behaviour of the other namespaces.

These two points are also the only unit tests that fail when Elektra 0.8.12 is used with 0.8.11 unit tests.

# 0.8.11 Release

- guid: 7d4647d4-4131-411e-9c2a-2aca39446e18
- author: Markus Raab
- pubDate: Fri, 03 Apr 2015 02:39:37 +0200

From the beginning of the Elektra Initiative, Elektra aimed at avoiding
hard-coded information in the application and to make the application's
configuration more transparent. While avoiding any pathes to files was
reality from the first released Elektra version, now also hard-coding
default values, fallback mechanisms and even Elektra's pathes to keys
can be avoided.

How does that work?

Elektra 0.8.11 introduces a so called specification for the
application's configuration. It is located below its own namespace
`spec` (next to user and system).

Once the base path is known, the user can find out all Elektra
pathes used by an application, using:

    kdb ls spec/basepath

Keys in `spec` allow us to specify which keys are read by the application,
which fallback it might have and which is the default value using
meta data. The implementation of these features happened in `ksLookup`.
When cascading keys (those starting with `/`) are used following features
are now available (in the meta data of respective `spec`-keys):

- `override/#`: use these keys *in favour* of the key itself (note that
    `#` is the syntax for arrays, e.g. `#0` for the first element,
    `#_10` for the 11th and so on)
- `namespace/#`: instead of using all namespaces in the predefined order,
    one can specify which namespaces should be searched in which order
- `fallback/#`: when no key was found in any of the (specified) namespaces
    the `fallback`-keys will be searched
- `default`: this value will be used if nothing else was found

This technique does not only give you the obvious advantages, but
also provides complete transparency how a program will fetch a configuration
value. In practice that means that:

    kdb get "/sw/app/#0/promise"

will give you the *exact same value* as the application uses when it
lookups the key `promise`. Many `if`s and hardcoded values are avoided,
we simply fetch and lookup the configuration by following code:

    Key *parentKey = keyNew("/sw/app/#0", KEY_CASCADING_NAME, KEY_END);
    kdbGet(kdb, ks, parentKey);
    
    ksLookupByName(ks, "/sw/app/#0/promise", 0);

We see in that example that only Elektra pathes are hardcoded in
the application.  But those can be found out easily, completely without
looking in the source code. The technique is simple: append a
logger plugin and the KDB base path is printed to:

- stdout in the case of the plugin tracer
- syslog in the case of the plugin syslog
- journald in the case of the plugin journald

What we do not see in the program above are the default values and
fallbacks. They are only present in the so specification (namespace `spec`).
Luckily, the specification are key/value pairs, too. So we do not have
to learn something new, e.g. using the ni plugin we can specify:

    [promise]
    default=20
    fallback/#0=/somewhere/else
    namespace/#0=user

1.) When this file is mounted to `spec/sw/app/#0` we specify, that
    for the key `/sw/app/#0/promise` only the namespace `user` should be
    used.
2.) If this key was not found, but `/somewhere/else` is present, we will use
    this key instead.  The `fallback` technique is very powerful: it allows
    us to have (recursive) links between applications. In the example above,
    the application is tricked in receiving e.g. the key `user/somewhere/else`
    when `promise` was not available.
3.) The value `20` will be used as default, even if no configuration file
    is found.

Note that the fallback, override and cascading works on *key level*,
and not like most other systems have implemented, on
configuration *file level*.


## Namespaces

The specification gives the namespaces clearer semantics and
purpose. Key names starting with a namespace are connected to a
configuration source. E.g. keys starting with:

- `user` are keys from the home directory of the current user
- `system` are keys from the `/etc` directory of the current system
- `spec` are keys from the specification directory (configurable
    with KDB_DB_SPEC, typically `/usr/share/elektra/specification`)

When a key name starts with an `/` it means that it is looked up by
specification. Such a cascading key is not really present in the keyset
(except when a default value was found). They are neither received
nor stored by `kdbGet` and `kdbSet`.

Applications shall only lookup using cascading keys (starting with `/`).
If no specification is present, cascading of all namespaces is used as before.

Elektra will (always) continue to work for applications that do not have a
specification. We strongly encourage you, however, to write such a
specification, because:

- it helps the administrator to know which keys exist
- it documents the keys (including lookup behaviour and default value)
- and many more advantages to come in future releases..

## Simplification in the merging framework

As it turned out the concept of very granular merge strategies was hard to understand
for users of the three-way merging framework that emerged in the last year's
GSoC. While this granularity is desirable for flexibility, we
additionally wanted something easy to use. For that reason merge
configurations were introduced. These are simply preconfigured configurations for a merger
that arrange required strategies for the most common merging scenarios. Especially
they make sure that meta merging is handled correctly.

Have a look at the changes in the example
[src/libtools/examples/merging.cpp](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/src/libtools/examples/merging.cpp)
for an glimpse of the simplifications.

A big thanks to Felix Berlakovich!

The header files will be installed to /usr/include/elektra/merging, but they are
subject to be changed in the future (e.g. as they did in this release).

From the merging improvements some minor incompatibility happened in
`kdb import`. Not all merging strategies that worked in 0.8.10 work
anymore. Luckily, now its much simpler to choose the strategies.


## API

The main API kdb.h has two added lines. First a new method was added:

    ssize_t keyAddName(Key *key, const char *addName);

This method is already used heavily in many parts. Contrary to `keySetBaseName` and
`keyAddBaseName` it allows us to extend the path with more than one Element at once,
i.e. `/` are not escaped.

The other new line is the new enum value `KEY_FLAGS`.
This feature allows bindings to use any flags in keyNew without actually
building up variable argument lists.  (Thanks to Manuel Mausz)

As always, API+ABI is stable and compatible.


## Proposed

Many new functions are proposed and can be found in
[the doxygen docu](http://doc.libelektra.org/api/0.8.11/html) and in
[kdbproposal.h](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/src/include/kdbproposal.h).

Noteworthy is the method `keyGetNamespace` which allows us to query all
namespaces. Since this release we changed every occurrence of namespaces
(except documentation) with switch-statements around `keyGetNamespace`.
This allows us to add new more namespaces more easily. (Although its
currently not planned to add further namespaces.)

Finally, a bunch of new lookup options were added, which might not be
useful for the public API (they allow us to disable the
specification-aware features mentioned in the beginning).


## Obsolete and removed concepts

### umount

The concept that backends have a name (other than their mountpoint)
is now gone. Backends will simply be named with their escaped mountpath
below system/elektra/mountpoints without any confusing additional name.

Unmounting still works with the mountpath.

Removing this concept makes Elektra easier to understand and it also
removes some bugs. E.g. having mountpoints which do not differ except
having a `_` instead of a `/` would have caused problems with the
automatic name generation of Elektra 0.8.10.

Old mountpoints need to be removed with their 0.8.10 name
(`_` instead of `/`).

### directory keys

Additionally, the so called directory keys were also removed.
Elektra was and still is completely key/value based. The `/` separator
is only used for mountpoints.

### fstab

The plugin fstab is also improved: Slashes in mountpoints are
escaped properly with the internal escaping engine of keyAddBaseName()
(i.e. without any problematic `/` replacements).

### dirname

getDirName() was removed from C++, gi-lua, gi-python2, gi-python3,
swig-lua, swig-python2 and swig-python3. It was never present in C and
did not fit well with keyBaseName() (which returns an unescaped name,
which is not possible for the dirname). (Thanks to Manuel Mausz)

### invalid parent names

While empty (=invalid) names are still accepted as parentName to `kdbGet`
and `kdbSet` for compatibility reasons, but the parentKey

    Key *parentKey = keyNew("/", KEY_END);

should be used instead (if you want to get or store everything).
They have identical behaviour, except that
invalid names (that cannot be distinguished from empty names) will
produce a warning. In the next major version invalid parentNames
will produce an error.


## KDB Behaviour

It is now enforced that before a kdbSet() on a specific path a kdbGet()
on that path needs to be done. This was always documented that way and
is the only way to correctly detect conflicts, updates and missing
configuration files. Error #107 will be reported on violations.

Additionally, the handling with missing files was improved. Empty
keysets for a mountpoint now will remove a file. Such an empty file
is always up-to-date. Removing files has the same atomicity guarantees
as other operations.

The concurrency behaviour is at a very high level: as expected many processes
with many threads can each concurrently write to the key database,
without any inconsistent states: This is noted here because Elektra
works on standard configuration files without any guarding processes.

Filesystem problems, e.g. permission, now always lead to the same errors
(#9, #75, #109, #110), regardless of the storage plugin.


## Qt-Gui 0.0.6

Raffael Pancheri was very busy and did a lot of stabilizing work:

- Added markdown converter functionality for plugin documentation
- Integrated help (Whats this?)
- Added credits to other authors
- do not show storage/resolver plugins if a plugin of that kind has been selected
- added menu to newkey toolbar button to allow new array entries
- added option to include a configuration keyset when adding a plugin
- show included keys when creating the plugin configuration
- Added all storageplugins to namefilters
- Reimplement ErrorDialog
- Added undo/redo of all commands and correctly update the view
- modified ToolTip size
- Color animation on search results
- Refactored Buttons to accept shortcuts
- Updated Translations
- Colors are now customizeable
- Many small fixes

The gui is already used and the remaining small bugs (see github)
are going to be fixed soon. One of the highlights is undo for
nearly every action, so nothing prevents you from trying it out!

A huge thanks to Raffael Pancheri for his contributions. His thesis can
be found at [here](http://www.libelektra.org/ftp/elektra/pancheri2015gui.pdf).


## Bug fixing

- fix issues with escaped backslashes in front of slashes
- atomic commits across namespaces work again
- memleak on ReadFile error in ni plugin
- `kdb getmeta` reports errorcode if key, but no meta was found
- `ksLookup` now will also work if a key of the keyset is used as
    search-key (aliasing problem fixed by dup() on namelock)
- resolver regex does not match to wrongly written plugins
- jna plugin is now named libelektra-0.8.11.jar, with proper symlink to current version, for every CMake version
- fix bashism ($RANDOM)
- new keys are correctly renamed, fixes OpenICC (thanks to Felix Berlakovich)
- comments in host keys are correctly restored (thanks to Felix Berlakovich)
- output stream in type checking is no longer locale dependent (thanks to Manuel Mausz)
- cmake uninstall works again
- simplify CMAKE_DL_LIBS (thanks to Manuel Mausz)

## Further gems

- Examples were improved, added (e.g. cascading, namespace) and included in
  [Doxygen docu](http://doc.libelektra.org/api/0.8.11/html).
- [METADATA specification](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/METADATA.ini)
    was nearly completely rewritten (thanks to Felix Berlakovich)
- benchmarks were greatly enhanced (runtime+heap profiling),
    and some important performance improvements were done
- All plugins now use the cmake function `add_plugin`
    (thanks to Ian Donnelly for most of the work)
- data directory (keysets as C-files) is now shared between different
    kinds of test suites.
- many more tests were added, e.g. distribution tests, KDB API tests;
  and allocation tests were readded
- now all kdb commands accept cascading keys.
- More compiler warning-flags are added and many warnings are fixed
- cleanup of old unused `keyName` methods
- The key `system/elektra/mountpoints` itself was always created and a
    left-over on a freshly installed system after the unit tests run the
    first time. The physical presence of the key is now irrelevant and
    it won't be created automatically.
- Bash completion was greatly improved (thanks to Manuel Mausz)
- Configure scripts were refactored and are now much shorter (thanks to Manuel Mausz)
- New Debian build agents were added that are magnitutes faster than the old ones (a big thanks to Manuel Mausz)
- Many KDB tests, written in C, lua and python were added (thanks to Manuel Mausz)
- SWIG3 is preferred when available
- add the plugin counter that counts how often the methods of a plugin are called
- `kdb list-tools` is now advertised in `kdb --help`
- Mac OS X support was greatly improved, thanks to Peter Nirschl
  and Kai-Uwe Behrmann. The feature rich resolver, now also works
  for Mac OS X.  wresolver is now only needed for mingw.
- Elektra still compiles with gcc (also mingw variants), icc and clang.


## Further Notes

With 471 files changed, 27978 insertions(+), 11512 deletions(-) this
release is huge. With 773 commits over four month much more changes
happened which did not find their place in these release notes, even
though the notes are much less detailed than usual.

## XDG Compatibility

Elektra now is
[fully XDG 0.8](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.8.html)
compliant. Following changes were necessary:

- newly created configuration files for user/ now have the permissions
  0600
- newly created configuration directories for user/ now have the
  permissions 0700
- existing configuration files will retain their permissions.
- The default path to store user configuration is now ~/.config
- A new resolver variant x (for user and system) is introduced
 - implements handling of XDG environment variables
 - ignores empty dirs and absolute pathes in envvar
- add new shell based test suite for (xdg)-resolver

For example, we could use resolver_fm_xhp_x:

    kdb mount --resolver=resolver_fm_xhp_x file.dump /example dump
    kdb file user/example
    kdb file system/example

Will show you that for both user+system the resolver respects
XDG environment variables, e.g. above lines will print:

    /home/m/.config/file.dump
    /etc/xdg/file.dump

Of course, any attempts to get and set keys below user/example and
system/example will also be in these files.

The letters after _ describe the variant of the resolver:

- f .. file based locking
- m .. mutex based locking (for multiple KDB per process)
- for user configuration (after next _)
 - x .. first check XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment
 - h .. then check HOME environment
 - p .. then fall back to passwd
- for system configuration (after next _)
 - x .. check all pathes in XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and falls back to /etc/xdg

A lot of such resolver variants are added when -DPLUGINS=ALL is used.
Of course you can create new variants with different behaviour by adding
them to PLUGINS.

To make your application (that uses Elektra) XDG aware, you have nothing
to do: you get it to free. Make sure to always use cascading lookup.
Additionally, an XDG conforming application should not write system/
keys.




## OpenICC Compatibility

Based on that, Elektra now also implements the draft for
[the OpenICC specification](http://www.openicc.info/wiki/index.php?title=OpenICC_Configuration_0.1).

The mount command looks like quite complicated, but it consists of
simple parts:

    kdb mount --resolver=resolver_fm_xhp_x \
      color/settings/openicc-devices.json /org/freedesktop/openicc \
      yajl rename cut=org/freedesktop/openicc

We already know the first two lines: we use the XDG resolver already
introduced above. Only the file name and the path where it should be
mounted differs.

The plugin yajl is a storage plugin that reads/writes json. The plugin
rename was the missing link to support OpenICC (thanks to Felix
Berlakovich for closing this gap). It is needed, because every OpenICC
file starts like this:

    { "org": { "freedesktop": { "openicc": {

Because the backend is mounted at /org/freedesktop/openicc, it would
lead to keys below /org/freedesktop/openicc/org/freedesktop/openicc
which we obviously do not want. So we simply get rid of the common
prefix by cutting it out using the rename plugin.

Of course this renaming functionality can be used in every situation and
is not limited to OpenICC.




## Tools

A large number of old and new tools were added, mostly for convenience
e.g.:

    kdb mount-openicc

saves you from writing the long mount command we had in the previous
section.

To get a list of all tools that are installed, now the command (which is
also an external tool and as such currently not displayed in kdb --help):

    kdb list-tools

is available. Do not be surprised: on typical installations this will
be a large list. You can run each of these tools by using kdb <command>.
Most of the tools, however, are part of the test suite,
which you can run using:

    kdb run_all

Other tools are "old friends", e.g. convert-fstab written in 2006 by Avi
Alkalay still works:

    kdb convert-fstab | kdb import system/filesystems xmltool

It will parse your /etc/fstab and generate a XML. This XML then can be
imported. Other convert tools directly produce kdb commands, though.

kdb now uses KDB itself for many commands:

- /sw/kdb/current/resolver .. You always want a different default
    resolver than that was compiled in as default when mounting
    backends?
- /sw/kdb/current/format .. If you are annoyed by the default format
    dump format for import/export.
- /sw/kdb/current/plugins .. If you always forget to add some plugins
    when mounting something.

By default the plugin "sync" is added automatically (it makes sure that
fsync is executed on config files, the directory is already done by the
resolver), you should not remove it from /sw/kdb/current/plugins
otherwise the next mount command will not add it. To preserve it use a
space separated list, e.g.:

    kdb set user/sw/kdb/current/plugins "sync syslog"

Last, but not least, kdb get now supports cascading get:

    kdb get /sw/kdb/current/plugins

This feature allows you to see the configuration exactly as seen by the
application.

Other options:

- -123 options for hiding nth column in `kdb mount`
- hide warnings during script usage of `kdb mount`
- -0 option accepted in some tools (null termination)
- Mount got a new -c option for backend configuration. For example
  -c cut=org/freedesktop/openicc would be the parameter cut for all
  plugins. Have a look at #146 if you want to use it.



## Compatibility

The core API (kdb.h), as always, stayed API/ABI compatible. The only
changes in kdb.h is the addition of KEY_CASCADING_NAME and
KEY_META_NAME. So applications compiled against 0.8.10 and using these
constants, will not work with Elektra 0.8.9.

The constants allow us to create following kinds of keys:

- empty names: this was always possible, because invalid names
  (including empty names) did not cause keyNew to abort
- meta names: this is a new feature that allows us to compare key names
  with meta keys
- cascading names: names starting with / have the special meaning that
  they do not specify which namespace they have. When such names are
  used for
  - kdbGet() and kdbSet() keys are retrieved from all namespaces
  - ksLookup() keys are searched in all namespaces
  - ksLookupByName() is now just a wrapper for ksLookup().
      The method does not do much except creating a key and passing
      them to ksLookup().

Usage in C is:

    Key *c = keyNew("/org/freedesktop", KEY_CASCADING_NAME, KEY_END);
    Key *m = keyNew("comment/#0", KEY_META_NAME, KEY_END);

The same functionality exists, of course, in available in all bindings,
too.

Changes in non-core API are:

- xmltool now does not output default (unchanged) uid,gid and mode
- ksLookupBySpec from kdbproposal.h was removed, is now integrated into
    ksLookup
- extension keyNameGetNamespace was removed
- the hosts comment format has changed
- the default resolver has changed (uses passwd)
- kdb::tools::Backend::Backend constructor, tryPlugin and addPlugin
  have changed:
 - mountname is now automatically calculated
 - addPlugin allows us to add a KeySet to validate plugins with different
     contracts correctly
- C++ binding now throws std::bad_alloc on allocation problems (and not
  InvalidName)


## CMake

It is now possible to remove a plugin/binding/tools by prefixing a name
with "-".  The new "-element" syntax is accepted by TOOLS, BINDINGS and
PLUGINS. It is very handy in combination with ALL, e.g.:

    -DPLUGINS="ALL;-xmltool"

will include all plugins except xmltool.



## Improved comments

Comment preserving was improved a lot. Especially, the hosts plugin was
rewritten completely. Now multiple different comment styles can be
intermixed without losing information. E.g. some INI formats support
both ; and # for comments. With the new comments it is possible to
preserve that information and even better: applications can iterate
over that information (meta data).

To mount the new hosts plugin use (if you already have mounted it, you
have nothing to do):

    kdb mount /etc/hosts system/hosts hosts

The hosts plugin now seperates from ipv4 and ipv6 which makes the host
names canonical again, e.g.:

    kdb get system/hosts/ipv4/localhost
    kdb get system/hosts/ipv6/localhost

To access the inline-comment, use:

    kdb getmeta system/hosts/ipv4/localhost "comment/#0"

For other meta information, see:

    kdb lsmeta system/hosts/ipv4/localhost 

Additionally, a small API for specific meta-data operations emerges.
These operations will be moved to a separate library and will not stay
in Elektra's core library.



## Proposal

- lookup options:
 - KDB_O_SPEC uses the lookup key as specification
 - KDB_O_CREATE creates a key if it could not be found
- elektraKeyGetMetaKeySet creates a KeySet from meta data
- elektraKsFilter allows us to filter a KeySet arbitrarily (not only
    keyIsBelow in case of ksCut). It reintroduces more functional
    programming.
- keyGetNamespace was reintroduced. In one of the next versions of
  Elektra we will introduce new namespaces. keyGetNamespace allows the
  compiler to output a warning when some namespaces are not handled in
  your C/C++ code.



## Java binding

Elektra now fully supports applications written in Java and also Plugins
written in the same language.

The
[new binding was developed using jna.](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/jna)
For the
[plugin interface JNI](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/plugins/jni)
was used.
We developed already
[some plugins](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/jna/elektra/plugin).


## Qt-Gui

Raffael Pancheri released the version 0.0.2 of the Qt-Gui:

* added Backend Wizard for mounting
* user can hover over TreeView items and quickly see keyname, keyvalue 
  and metakeys
* it is now easily possible to create and edit arrays
* added header to MetaArea for better clarity
* many small layout and view update fixes


## Further stuff and small fixes

- Two new error/warnings information: mountpoint and configfile.
    It is added automatically and all tools will print it.
- C++ I/O for key(s) now allows null terminator next to new-line
    terminator
- fix error plugin: now use on_open/trigger_warnings to be consistent
- fix metaset: now correctly append new key
- arrays are also available when compiled with mingw
   (but tests still have to be excluded for successful compilation)
- fix #136
- fix long help text in `kdb check`
- signed release tags are now used

# 0.8.9 Release

- guid: 38640673-3e07-4cff-9647-f6bdd89b1b08
- author: Markus Raab
- pubDate: Tue, 04 Nov 2014 10:48:14 +0100

Again we managed to do an amazing feature release in just two month.
In 416 commits we modified 393 files with 23462 insertions(+) and
9046 deletions(-).

## Most awaited

The most awaited feature in this release is certainly the *qt-gui*
developed by Raffael Pancheri. It includes a rich feature set including
searching, unmounting, importing and exporting. A lot of functionality
is quite stable now, even though its version is 0.0.1 alpha. If you find
any bugs or want to give general feedback, feel free to use the issue
tracker of the Elektra project. A screenshot can be found
[here](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/images/screenshot-qt-gui.png)
To compile it (together with Elektra), see the README
[here](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/tools/qt-gui)

Manuel Mausz also has been very active and developed glib+gi bindings.
These bindings make Elektra more friendly to the glib/gtk/gnome world.
Using the gobject introspection python3 and lua bindings were developed.
Additionally he got rid of all clang warnings.

Felix Berlakovich also made progress: [the ini
plugin](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/plugins/ini)
now supports multiline and
which can be dynamically turned on and off, i.e. during mounting
(thanks to Felix)

Last, but not least, Kai-Uwe ported Elektra to Windows7. MinGW is now
one more supported compiler (tested on build-server, see later).
Astonishingly, it was only little effort necessary:
Basically we only needed a new implementation of the resolver, which
is now called *wresolver*. Different from the *resolver* it lacks the
sophisticated multi-process and multi-thread atomicity properties. On
the plus side we now have a resolver that is very easy to study and
understand and still works as file resolver (_noresolver_ does not).


## Interfaces

ABI/API of the C-API is still completely stable even though under the
hood a lot was changed. All testcases compiled against the previous
version still run against Elektra 0.8.9.

This is, however, not the case for libtools. For MinGW porting it was
necessary to rename an enum related to merging because it conflicted
with an already defined MACRO.

For maintainers also some changes are necessary. For MinGW and to
actually use the flexibility of the new resolver variants two new CMake
Variables are introduced: KDB_DEFAULT_RESOLVER and KDB_DEFAULT_STORAGE.

More importantly for maintainers the CMake variables regarding SWIG
bindings are now abandoned in favour to the new variable BINDINGS that
works like PLUGINS and TOOLS. Just start with

	-DBINDINGS=ALL

and CMake should remove the bindings that have missing dependencies
on your system. Remember that glib and gi (i.e. *gi_python3* and
*gi_lua*) bindings were introduced, too. Additionally, the *cpp*
binding can now be deactivated if not added to BINDINGS.

Finally, the *gen* tool added a Python package called `support`.



## Other Bits

A proof of concept storage plugin `regexstore` was added. It allows one to
capture individual configuration options within an otherwise not
understood configuration file (e.g. for vimrc or emacs where
the configuration file may contain programming constructs).

Most tests now also work with the BUILD_SHARED variant (from our
knowledge all would work now, but some are still excluded if
BUILD_FULL and BUILD_STATIC is disabled. Please report issues
if you want to use uncommon CMake combinations).

A small but very important step towards specifying configuration files
is the new proposed API method ksLookupBySpec (and ksLookup implementing
cascading search). It introduces a `logical view` of
configuration that in difference to the `physical view` of
configuration does not have namespaces, but everything is below the root
"/". Additionally, contextual values now allow to be compile-time
configured using C++-Policies. These are small puzzle pieces that will
fit into a greater picture at a later time.

A (data) race detection tool was implemented. Using it a configurable
number of processes and threads it tries to kdbSet() a different
configuration at (nearly) the same time.

With this tool the resolver could be greatly be improved (again). It now
uses stat with nanosecond precision that will be updated for every
successful kdbSet(). Even if the configuration file was modified
manually (not using Elektra) the next kdbSet() then is much more likely
to fail.  Additionally a recursive mutex now protects the file locking
mechanism.

The build server now additionally has following build jobs:

- [i386 build:](http://build.libelektra.org:8080/job/elektra-gcc-i386/):
  We had an i386 regression, because none of the developers
  seems to use i386 anymore.
- [Configure Debian Script](http://build.libelektra.org:8080/job/elektra-gcc-configure-debian/)
  Calls the scripts/configure-debian(-wheezy).
- [Local Installation:](http://build.libelektra.org:8080/job/elektra-local-installation/)
  We had an regression that local installation was not possible because
  of a bash completion file installed to /etc. This build tests if it is
  possible to install Elektra in your home directory (and calls kdb
  run_all afterwards)
- [Test bindings:](http://build.libelektra.org:8080/job/elektra-test-bindings/)
  Compiles and tests ALL bindings.
- [Mingw:](http://build.libelektra.org:8080/job/elektra-gcc-configure-mingw/)
  Compiles Elektra using mingw.

Many more examples were written and are used within doxygen. Most
snippets now can also be found in compilable files:


- [keyNew examples](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/examples/keyNew.c)
- [keyCopy examples](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/examples/keyCopy.c)
- [C++ deep dup](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/cpp/examples/cpp_example_dup.cpp)
- [How to put Key in different data structures](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/src/bindings/cpp/examples/cpp_example_ordering.cpp)
- [Mount some config files using augeas](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/scripts/mount-augeas)
- [Mount system information](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/tree/master/scripts/mount-info)

Most plugins now internally use the same CMake function `add_plugin`
which makes plugin handling more consistent.

Felix converted the METADATA spec to ini files and added a proposal
how comments can be improved.

### Refactoring:

- reuse of utilities in gen code generator
- the gen support library is now in its own package (`support`)
- refactor array handling
- internal comparision functions (keyCompareByName)

### Optimization:

- lookupByName does not need to allocate two keys
- lookups in generated code
- prefer to use allocation on stack

### Fixes:

- disable cast that segfaults on i386 (only testing code was affected)
- fix keyAddBaseName in xmltool and testing code
- support non-system installation (e.g. in home directory)
- rewrote test cases to use succeed_if_same to avoid crashes on
  null pointers
- allow to use python 2.6 for kdb gen
- improve exception messages
- use memcasecmp (fix lookup ignoring case)
- fix memory leaks (ini)
- text messages for some warnings/errors
- fix many issues regarding CMake, more variants of setting CMake
  options are now allowed.
- cmake policies fixes allow us to use cmake version > 3

# 0.8.8 Release

- guid: eca69e19-5ddb-438c-ac06-57c20b1a9160
- author: Markus Raab
- pubDate: Tue, 02 Sep 2014 17:31:42 +0200


In this release we changed 578 files in 473 commits
(68596 insertions(+), 59260 deletions(-) compared to Elektra 0.8.7).
We assume thats the largest change set for any of Elektra's releases
up to now. It happened only within a bit more than a month up
(0.8.7 was released 28.07.2014).


## New features

GSoC finished successfully (thanks Ian and Felix)
See http://community.libelektra.org/wp for the latest results.
So Elektra now has a 3-way merging framework that is superior
to text-based merging in many scenarios (e.g. moving configuration
options within a file or with in-line comments) iff a storage plugin
creates key names that are not only line numbers.
We love to get Feedback!

Writing plugins is now even more comfortable.
A plugin writer tutorial was written (thanks Ian):
https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/doc/tutorials/plugins.md
The documentation was completely reworked:
http://doc.libelektra.org/api/0.8.7/html/group__plugin.html
And two new macros allow printf formating for warnings and errors
(ELEKTRA_ADD_WARNINGF and ELEKTRA_SET_ERRORF).

The ini plugin was greatly improved (tested with samba configurations
and added to ALL plugins) and the hosts plugin was rewritten to support
ipv6 properly (thanks to Felix).

The constants plugin was added and allows introspection of Elektra's
cmake variables. Because such non-file based plugins (e.g. also uname)
do not need resolving, the plugin noresolver was added. It supersedes
the success plugin.

Elektra now allows one to correctly fsync its configuration files
(sync plugin) and the folders where files are stored (resolver plugin).
Just make sure to add the "sync" plugin using kdb mount.
The resolver plugin now reads from passwd and no longer needs
environment variables.  Additionally, the resolver plugin was prepared
to support other variants by so called compilation variants.

The error plugin now allows, next to list all possible errors, to
provoke errors when opening plugins. We fixed some issues related
to plugins having errors when they initialize themselves.

So following plugins were added: sync noresolver line ini constants
Nearly all plugins now have a README.md for further information
(thanks to Ian). An overview of all plugin is on with links to them:
https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/blob/master/src/plugins/

The kdb tools were greatly improved (thanks to Felix):
- added remount tool
- umount now also accepts mountpath
- mount allows one to specify different resolvers
- import now can use merge strategies
- check without arguments checks key database
- mount is now more verbose when validation fails

New/improved scripts/make targets (note that scripts can be executed by
kdb scriptname):
- mounting, unmounting scripts were added
- generate template for a new plugin was improved
- configure-debian was added
- added targets run_all and run_memcheck
- bash completion file now installed
- ucf integration
- merging scripts were added for the usage with ucf
- scripts doing internal checks on source of plugins


## Compatibility

This time we had to break compatibility. We did not change the ABI (your
application still will be able to use Elektra 0.8.8) and we did not
change the API (your application still will compile against Elektra). We
changed the third part of our interface: the semantic interface.

The problems were following:
keyAddBaseName/keySetBaseName did something obvious when no special
characters were in the baseName. But once there were, there are two
different interpretations what it should do:
1.) add/set a basename, so escape characters that are not canonical
    in the basename
2.) add all parts of the name given (with slashes)

The methods were used in both ways, so it was obvious that something is
very wrong. We decided that it should do what the name says, that is
add/set a basename (variant 1).

The variant 2, to add any name was added and is called keyAddName() and
added as proposal.

(Thank Felix for implementations and Manuel for investigations)

When keys are renamed after adding to a keyset is a bad thing because it
destroys the order of the keyset. This is now avoided by keyLock.
Use keyDup() to get rid of such locks.

Another, even larger, change is also about ordering of keys in keysets.
Elektra now internally has an null-terminated unescaped keyname.
Ordering of keysets will always happen on this name. The keyCmp() tool
can be used to check this order. It works very efficiently with
memcmp() and never gets confused by ASCII ordering of / (because / is
0 in the unescaped keyname).

The syntax, semantics and conventions of key names is now documented in
detail:
http://doc.libelektra.org/api/0.8.8/html/group__keyname.html

ksNew() does now return a keyset with a properly set cursor (ksRewind).

Because its always possible that software relies on bugs the
better way to deal with such a situation (as the keySetBaseName()
situation described above) is to provide the same function twice.
Manuel said he will create a prototype to introduce symbol versioning
in Elektra. With that, old customers would still receive the old
behaviour, but people compiling against a new version would get the new
behaviour. So in one of the next releases we will also avoid semantic
interface changes when there is a valid use case for it (there is none
if the program e.g.  crashes).

Symbol versioning also allows one to compile against old versions on
purpose if you do not want the new behaviour.

We have prepared an ABI-test suite, that also checks behaviour,
for that purpose, but we also improved testing in other parts:
- (New Test strategy)[/doc/TESTING.md]
- New resolver tests for conflicts (needs tty)

If you try to execute test_ks from 0.8.7 with libelektra 0.8.8 it will
crash, but not because of any incompatibility, but because of strcmp in
the test itself gets a null pointer. The pointer is now null, because
ksNew correctly rewinds its internal cursor (see above). Amusingly,
it says on that line 94 in test_ks.c:
  // TODO: why is the cursor here?

## API Proposals

see above for more information:
- keyAddName         ..  add key name without escaping, like keySetName
- keyUnescapedName   ..  get access to null-separated unescaped name
- keyLock            ..  to allow to secure keys against modifications

some new ideas:
- keySetStringF      ..  printf format-style changing of the key string
- elektraKeySetName  ..  to allow to set meta + cascading keys

elektraArrayIncName() now works correctly with empty arrays embedded in
other arrays (yajl+line plugin)

elektraArrayValidateName() was also added, thanks to Felix.

These methods are declared in the file kdbproposal.h
but do not guarantee any forms of compatibility (they might
even be removed).


## Issues

Many issues were resolved as you can see in github:
https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues
Alone for the milestone 0.8.8 we closed 17 issues, including
those mentioned in "Compatibility". Other issues (not all were
tracked on github):

- fix undefined errors in kdbOpen() or kdbClose()
- Now Python 2+3 work in parallel
- python2 interpreter is found correctly (also on Arch)
- Sentinel now makes sure that you cannot forget KS_END to end ksNew
- Fixes for architecture-specific problems by Pino
- fix .pc file
- fix compilation problem with KDB_MAX_PATH_LENGTH
- tmpnam to mkstemp (security)
- make test data naming consistent (thanks Pino)
- use LIB_SUFFIX for TARGET_TOOL_EXEC_FOLDER thanks to Kai Uwe
- Fix search for boost (thank Pino)

## Other Stuff ##

Thanks to Pino Toscano Elektra 0.8.7-4 is now available in Debian
Testing: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=elektra
So it is only a matter of time that other (debian-based) distributions
will follow and replace the dusty Elektra 0.7.

Debian Continuous Integration http://ci.debian.net/packages/e/elektra
(thanks Pino)
greatly complement our tests running on http://build.libelektra.org:8080/

Elektra's buildserver also was improved:

 - now also compiles with icc
 - runs make run_memcheck
 - checks if plugins are added correctly in-source
 - runs ABI + behavioural tests

Raffael Pancheri now made a merge request for qt-gui
https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/pull/103/files
in which copy, paste and delete of keys already works.
It is, however, still work in progress.

Manuel Mausz made great progress in script-based Elektra plugins. He is
also working on glib+gobject-introspection based bindings.
He investigated some issues, e.g. a crash of the python binding which
