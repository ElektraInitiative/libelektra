`int keyDel(Key *key)`

## Checklist

#### Doxygen
(bullet points are in order of appearance)

- [x] First line explains briefly what the function does
- [ ] Simple example or snippet how to use the function  
      - [ ] add example
- [x] Longer description of function containing common use cases
- [x] Description of functions reads nicely
- [ ] `@pre`  
      - [ ] @pre Key must not be null
- [ ] `@post`  
      - [ ] @post Key memory has been freed
- [ ] `@invariant  
      - [ ] add (tbd)
- [x] `@param` for every parameter
- [ ] `@return` / `@retval`  
      - [ ] `0` when the key was freed and no references are held in keysets
- [ ] `@since`  
      - [ ] add
- [x] `@ingroup`
- [x] `@see`

### Naming

- [x] Abbreviations used in function names must be defined in the
      [Glossary](/doc/help/elektra-glossary.md)
- [x] Function names should neither be too long, nor too short
- [x] Function name should be clear and unambiguous
- [x] Abbreviations used in parameter names must be defined in the
      [Glossary](/doc/help/elektra-glossary.md)
- [x] Parameter names should neither be too long, nor too short
- [x] Parameter names should be clear and unambiguous

### Compatibility
(only in PRs)

- [Symbol versioning](/doc/dev/symbol-versioning.md)
      is correct for breaking changes
- ABI/API changes are forward-compatible (breaking backwards-compatibility
      to add additional symbols is fine)

### Parameter & Return Types

- [x] Function parameters should use enum types instead of boolean types
      wherever sensible
- [x] Wherever possible, function parameters should be `const`
- [ ] Wherever possible, return types should be `const`  
      - [ ] could maybe change this to const
- [x] Functions should have the least amount of parameters feasible

### Structural Clarity

- [x] Functions should do exactly one thing
- [x] Function name has the appropriate prefix
- [ ] Order of signatures in kdb.h.in is the same as Doxygen  
      - [ ] swap keyClear and keyDel
- [x] No functions with similar purpose exist

### Memory Management

- [x] Memory Management should be handled by the function wherever possible

### Extensibility

- [x] Function is easily extensible, e.g., with flags
- [ ] Documentation does not impose limits, that would hinder further extensions  
      - [ ] TBD cannot change behaviour of referenced keys

### Tests

- [x] Function code is fully covered by tests
- [x] All possible error states are covered by tests
- All possible enum values are covered by tests
- [x] No inconsistencies between tests and documentation
