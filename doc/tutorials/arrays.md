# Arrays

## Key-Value Pairs

The main building block of Elektra’s database are hierarchical [key-value pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database). You can create such a pair using [`kdb set`](../help/kdb-set.md):

```sh
kdb set user:/tests/parent value
#> Create a new key user:/tests/parent with string "value"
```

. The command above created a key `user:/tests/parent` with the value `value`. Since Elektra uses a hierarchical database we can also create keys **below** `user:/tests/parent`:

```sh
# We can create keys with an empty value by passing an empty string.
kdb set user:/tests/parent/son ""
#> Create a new key user:/tests/parent/son with string ""

kdb set user:/tests/parent/daughter ""
#> Create a new key user:/tests/parent/daughter with string ""

kdb set user:/tests/parent/daughter/grandchild ""
#> Create a new key user:/tests/parent/daughter/grandchild with string ""
```

. We can check the hierarchy of the keys using `kdb ls` and retrieve data using `kdb get`:

```sh
# Elektra sorts keys alphabetically
kdb ls user:/tests/parent
#> user:/tests/parent
#> user:/tests/parent/daughter
#> user:/tests/parent/daughter/grandchild
#> user:/tests/parent/son

kdb get user:/tests/parent
#> value
kdb get user:/tests/parent/daughter
#>
```

.

## Array Keys

Since Elektra sorts keys alphabetically we can use the key-value pair structure described above to store sequences of values (aka. arrays).

### Empty Arrays

For an **empty array** (`[]`) we just add the [metakey](../help/elektra-metadata.md) `array`:

```sh
# Create an empty array with the name `user:/tests/sequence`
kdb meta-set user:/tests/sequence array ''
```

.

### Array Elements

To create an **array element** we start the basename of a key with the `#` character and add the index of the array element afterwards. For example, the commands below adds three elements to our array `user:/tests/sequence`:

```sh
kdb set user:/tests/sequence/#0 'First Element'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/sequence/#0 with string "First Element"
kdb set user:/tests/sequence/#1 'Second Element'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/sequence/#1 with string "Second Element"
# Arrays do not need to be contiguous
kdb set user:/tests/sequence/#3 'Fourth Element'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/sequence/#3 with string "Fourth Element"
```

. As you can see above arrays can contain “empty fields”: The key `user:/tests/sequence/#2` is missing.

For array elements with an index larger than `9` we must add **underscores** (`_`) to the basename, so we do not destroy the alphabetic order of the array. For example, to add an eleventh element to our array we use the following command:

```sh
kdb set user:/tests/sequence/#_10 'Eleventh Element'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/sequence/#_10 with string "Eleventh Element"
```

. The order of the array sequence is still correct afterwards, as the following command shows:

```sh
# List all array elements
kdb ls user:/tests/sequence/
#> user:/tests/sequence/#0
#> user:/tests/sequence/#1
#> user:/tests/sequence/#3
#> user:/tests/sequence/#_10
```

. For larger indices we add **one underscore less, than the number of digits** of the index. For example, to add an element with index `1337` (`4` digits) we use the basename `#___1337`. We can also generate the basename programmatically:

```bash
ruby -e 'print("#", "_" * (ARGV[0].length - 1), ARGV[0])' 12345
#> #____12345

ruby -e 'print("#", "_" * (ARGV[0].length - 1), ARGV[0])' 0
#> #0

ruby -e 'print("#", "_" * (ARGV[0].length - 1), ARGV[0])' 42
#> #_42
```

.

### Metadata

Elektra’s arrays **require** that you always add the metakey `array` to the array parent. Otherwise the values below the parent will not be interpreted as array elements, but rather as normal key-value pairs. To make the `array` metakey more useful [storage plugins](plugins.md) should save the [basename of the last key in the array parent](../decisions/array.md). This of course works only, if the plugins already stores this information in the config file, either

- implicitly (e.g. the data below the array parent is stored as array/list/sequence in the config file), or
- explicitly (e.g. the plugin stores the metakey `array` directly in the config file)

. Either way, in some situations you might have to add this value manually via `kdb meta-set`:

```sh
# Add array elements
kdb set user:/tests/favorites/superheros/#0 'One-Punch Man'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/favorites/superheros/#0 with string "One-Punch Man"
kdb set user:/tests/favorites/superheros/#1 'Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/favorites/superheros/#1 with string "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy"
kdb set user:/tests/favorites/superheros/#____99999 'The guy with the bow and arrow'
#> Create a new key user:/tests/favorites/superheros/#____99999 with string "The guy with the bow and arrow"

# The metakey `array` should save the basename of the last element.
kdb meta-set user:/tests/favorites/superheros array '#____99999'
```

. This way you can always retrieve the last element of an array easily:

```sh
kdb get user:/tests/favorites/superheros/`kdb meta-get user:/tests/favorites/superheros array`
#> The guy with the bow and arrow
```

.

# Closing Remarks

We close this tutorial by removing the data created by the commands above:

```sh
kdb rm -r user:/tests
```
