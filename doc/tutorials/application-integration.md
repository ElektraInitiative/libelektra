# Introduction

Applications should use Elektra to read (and store) configurations for a
overall better integrated system.
A light integration would be to write parsers for the configuration files
of your application as Elektra plugin. This yields the following advantages:

- applications and administrators can easily change individual values
- import/export of configuration


For full integration, however, the application needs to be patched
to directly access Elektra's key database.
When the application is fully integrated in Elektra's ecosystem
additional benefits arise:

- Benefits that shared libraries have, e.g.
 - All applications profit from fixes, optimization and new features
 - Less memory consumption, because the libraries executable
     instructions are only loaded once
 - Faster development time, because many non-trivial problems (e.g.
     OS-dependent resolving of configuration file names with atomic
     updates) are already solved and tested properly
- The administrator can choose:
 - the configuration file syntax (e.g. XML or JSON)
 - notification and logging on configuration changes
 - and all other features [the plugins provide](/src/plugins/)
- Other applications can use your configuration as override or as
    fallback

## Elektrify

The process to make applications aware of other's configuration is called
"to elektrify". This tutorial is both for new and existing applications.

When a software starts to use Elektra, it is called to be elektrified.
The places where configuration is parsed or generated must be located.
Afterwards, Elektra's data structures must be used instead at these
locations.  In Elektra 0.7, that was nearly everything the software
developer could do.

Now more optional possibilities are open.  First, the parser and generator
code can be moved to a storage plugin without having to rewrite additional
parts.  Doing this, the syntax of the configuration file stays exactly
the same as it was before.  The application immediately profits from
Elektra's infrastructure solving basic issues like update and conflict
detection and resolving of the file name.

Moreover, a huge variety of plugins can be utilised to extend the
functionality of the configuration system and the programmer can write
supplementary plugins.  They can do syntactic checks, write out events
in their log files and notify users if configuration has changed.  So we
get a bunch of plugins that are reusable, and we gain a lot because
every other program can also access the configuration of this software.

For new software the situation is similar. Additionally, there is the
option to reuse mature and well-tested plugins to achieve the optimal
result for configuration. New applications simply do not have the burden
to stay compatible with the configuration system they had to before.
But they can also use self-written plugins for adding needed behaviour
or cross-cutting concerns.

To sum up, if a developer wants to **elektrify** software, he or she can
do that without any need for changes to the outside world regarding the
format and semantics of the configuration.  But in the interconnected
world it is only a matter of time until other software also wants to
access the configuration, and with elektrified software it is possible
for every application to do so.


## Get Started

As first step in a C-application you need to create an in-memory `Key`. Such a `Key` is
Elektra's atomic unit and consists of:

- a unique name
- a value
- metadata

`Key`s are either associated with entries in configuration files or used
as arguments in the API to transport some information.

Thus a key is only in-memory and does not need any of the other Elektra's objects.
We always can create one:

	Key *parentKey = keyNew("/sw/org/myapp/#0/current", KEY_END);

- The first argument of `keyNew` always is the name of the key.
 - `sw` is for software
 - `org` is a URL/organisation name to avoid name clashes with other
     application names. Use only one part of the URL/organisation,
     so e.g. `kde` is enough.
 - `myapp` is the name of the most specific component that has its own
     configuration
 - `#0` is the major version number of the configuration (to be incremented
   if you need to introduce incompatible changes).
 - `current` is the [profile](/src/plugins/profile/README.md)
     to be used. This is needed by administrators
     if they want to start up multiple applications with different
     configurations.
- `KEY_END` is needed because C needs a proper termination of variable
    length arguments.

- [Read more about key-functions in API doc.](http://doc.libelektra.org/api/current/html/group__key.html)
- [Read more about key names here.](/doc/help/elektra-key-names.md)


Now we have the `Key` we will use to pass as argument.
First we open our key database (KDB). This is done by:

	KDB *repo = kdbOpen(parentKey);

A `Key` is seldom alone, but they are often found in groups, e.g. in
configuration files. To represent many keys (a set of keys) Elektra
has the data structure `KeySet`. Because the `Key`'s name is unique we
can easily lookup keys in a `KeySet` without ambiguity. Additionally, we
can can iterate over all `Key`s in a `KeySet` without a hassle.
To create an empty `KeySet` we use:

	KeySet *conf = ksNew(200, KS_END);

- 200 is an approximation for how many `Key`s we think we will have in
    the `KeySet` conf
- After the first argument we can list hardcoded keys.
- The last argument needs to be `KS_END`.

Now we have everything ready to fetch the latest configuration:

	kdbGet(repo, conf, parentKey);


Note it is important for applications that the parentKey starts with a slash `/`.
Only then all so-called [namespace](/doc/help/elektra-namespaces.md)
are pulled in.
Such a name cannot physically exist in configuration files, but they are
the most important keys to actually work with configuration within
applications as we will see when introducing `ksLookup`.

## Lookup

To lookup a key, we simply use, e.g.:

	Key *k = ksLookupByName(conf,
		"/sw/org/myapp/#0/current/section/subsection/key",
		0);

We see in that example that only Elektra paths are hardcoded in
the application, no configuration file or similar.

As already mentioned keys starting with slash `/` do not exist
in configuration files, but are "representatives", "proxies" or
"logical placeholders" for keys from any other [namespace](/doc/help/elektra-namespaces.md).

So that every tool has a consistent view to the key database
it is vital that every application does a `ksLookup` for every
key it uses. So even if your application iterates over keys,
always remember to do a cascading lookup for every single key!

Thus we are interested in the value we use:

	char *val = keyString(k);

Finally, we need to convert the configuration value to the datatype we
need.

Obviously, to do this manually has severe drawbacks:

- names are hardcoded: might have typos or might be inconsistent
- tedious handling if key or value might be absent
- always calling `ksLookup` which gets tiresome for arrays
- converting to needed data type is error prone

So (larger) applications should not directly use `KeySet`, but
instead use code generation to provide a type-safe front-end.

## Specification

Now, we have a fully working configuration system without any hard-coded
information (such as configuration files). So we already gained something.
But, we did not discuss how we can actually achieve application integration,
the goal of Elektra.

Elektra 0.8.11 introduces the so called specification for the
application's configuration. It is located below its own [namespace](/doc/help/elektra-namespaces.md)
`spec` (next to user and system).

Keys in `spec` allow us to specify which keys are read by the application,
which fallback they might have and which is the default value using
metadata. The implementation of these features happened in `ksLookup`.
When cascading keys (those starting with `/`) are used following features
are now available (in the metadata of respective `spec`-keys):

- `override/#`: use these keys *in favour* of the key itself (note that
    `#` is the syntax for arrays, e.g. `#0` for the first element,
    `#_10` for the 11th and so on)
- `namespace/#`: instead of using all namespaces in the predefined order,
    one can specify which namespaces should be searched in which order
- `fallback/#`: when no key was found in any of the (specified) namespaces
    the `fallback`-keys will be searched
- `default`: this value will be used if nothing else was found

They can be used like this:

	kdb set /overrides/test "example override"
	sudo kdb setmeta spec/test override/#0 /overrides/test

This technique provides complete transparency how a program will fetch a configuration
value. In practice that means that:

    kdb get "/sw/org/myapp/#0/current/section/subsection/key",

will give you the *exact same value* as the application gets when it uses the
above lookup C-code.

What we do not see in the program above are the default values and
fallbacks. They are only present in the so specification (namespace `spec`).
Luckily, the specification consists of (meta) key/value pairs, too. So we do not have
to learn something new.

So lets say, that another application `otherapp` exactly has the
value we actually want. We want to better integrate the system, that
in the case we do not have a value for `/sw/org/myapp/#0/current/section/subsection/key`
we want to use `/sw/otherorg/otherapp/#0/current/section/subsection/key`.

So we specify:

    kdb setmeta spec/sw/org/myapp/#0/current/section/subsection/key "fallback/#0" /sw/otherorg/otherapp/#0/current/section/subsection/key

Voila, we have done a system integration between `myapp` and `otherapp`!

Note that the fallback, override and cascading works on *key level*,
and not like most other systems have implemented, on configuration *file level*.

To make this work within your application make sure to always call
`ksLookup` before using a value from Elektra.


## Conclusion

Elektra does not hardcode any configuration data in your application.
Using the `default` specification, we even can startup applications without
any configuration file *at all* and still do not have anything hardcoded
in the applications binary.
Furthermore, by only using cascading keys for `kdbGet()` and `ksLookup()`
Elektra gives you the possibility to specify how configuration data
should be retrieved. In this specification you can define, that
configuration data from other applications or shared places should
be considered or even preferred. Doing so, we can achieve configuration
integration.
