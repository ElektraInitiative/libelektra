# Installation on ArchLinux #

* Create a build directory and compile the library


	mkdir build

	cd build

	cmake ..


* Install the files using the generated Makefile


	sudo make install 


## Troubleshooting ##

If you encounter the problem that the library can not be found (output like this)

	kdb: error while loading shared libraries: libelektratools.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You need to create a configuration file under `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` (e.g. `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/elektra.conf`).

Add the path where the library has been installed

	/usr/lib/local/

and run `ldconfig` as root.
