# Install #

## Debian ##

If you want to rebuild Elektra from Debian unstable or
our repositories, add a `deb-src` entry to `/etc/apt/sources.list`
and then run:

	apt-get source -b elektra

To build Debian Packages from the source you might want to use:

	dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -sa

(You need to be in the Debian branch, see [GIT](GIT.md))

## Generic ##

First follow the steps in [COMPILE](COMPILE.md).

To install Elektra use:

	sudo make install
	sudo ldconfig  # See troubleshooting below

To uninstall Elektra use (will not be very clean,
e.g. it will not remove directories and `*.pyc` files):

	sudo make uninstall
	sudo ldconfig

or in the build directory (will not honor DESTDIR!):

	xargs rm < install_manifest.txt

## CPack ##

First follow the steps in [COMPILE](COMPILE.md).

Then use:

	cpack

which should create a package for distributions where a Generator is
implemented. See [this cmake file](/cmake/ElektraPackaging.cmake) for available Generators
and send a merge request for your system.


## Troubleshooting ##

### error loading libraries ###

If you encounter the problem that the library can not be found (output like this)

	kdb: error while loading shared libraries: libelektra-core.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

or:

	kdb: error while loading shared libraries: libelektratools.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

you need to place a configuration file at `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` (e.g. `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/elektra.conf`).

Add the path where the library has been installed

	/usr/lib/local/

and run `ldconfig` as root.

## Installation Manuals ##

For some of the plugins and tools that ship with Elektra,
additional installation manuals have been written.
You can find them in the [tutorial overview](tutorials/README.md).
