### Debian

To use the debian repository of the latest builds from master put following lines in
`/etc/apt/sources.list`:

For Stretch:

```
deb     [trusted=yes] https://debian-stretch-repo.libelektra.org/ stretch main
deb-src [trusted=yes] https://debian-stretch-repo.libelektra.org/ stretch main
```

Which can also be done using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
echo "deb     [trusted=yes] https://debian-stretch-repo.libelektra.org/ stretch main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elektra.list
```

Or alternatively, you can use (if you do not mind many dependences just to add one line to a config file):

```sh
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common apt-transport-https
sudo add-apt-repository "deb     [trusted=yes] https://debian-stretch-repo.libelektra.org/ stretch main"
```

For Jessie (not updated anymore, contains 0.8.24 packages which were created shortly before 0.8.25 release)

```
deb     [trusted=yes] https://debian-stable.libelektra.org/elektra-stable/ jessie main
deb-src [trusted=yes] https://debian-stable.libelektra.org/elektra-stable/ jessie main
```

For Wheezy (not updated anymore, contains 0.8.19-8121 packages):

```
deb     [trusted=yes] https://build.libelektra.org/debian/ wheezy main
deb-src [trusted=yes] https://build.libelektra.org/debian/ wheezy main
```

To get all packaged plugins, bindings and tools install:

```sh
apt-get install libelektra4-all
```

For a small installation with command-line tools available use:

```sh
apt-get install elektra-bin
```

If you want to rebuild Elektra from Debian unstable or
our repositories, add a `deb-src` entry to `/etc/apt/sources.list`
and then run:

```sh
apt-get source -b elektra
```

To build Debian Packages from the source you might want to use:

```sh
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -sa
```

(You need to be in the Debian branch, see [GIT](GIT.md))

## macOS

You can install Elektra using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) via the shell command:

```sh
brew install elektra
```

. We also provide a tap containing a more elaborate formula [here](http://github.com/ElektraInitiative/homebrew-elektra).

## Windows

Please refer to the section OS Independent below.

## OS Independent

First follow the steps in [COMPILE](COMPILE.md).

After you completed building Elektra on your own, there are multiple options how to install it. For example, with make or cPack tools.

### make

```sh
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig  # See troubleshooting below
```

To uninstall Elektra use (will not be very clean,
e.g. it will not remove directories and `*.pyc` files):

```sh
sudo make uninstall
sudo ldconfig
```

or in the build directory (will not honor `DESTDIR`!):

```sh
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```

### CPack

First follow the steps in [COMPILE](COMPILE.md).

Then use:

```sh
cpack
```

which should create a package for distributions where a Generator is
implemented. See [this cmake file](/cmake/ElektraPackaging.cmake) for available Generators
and send a merge request for your system.

## Troubleshooting

### Error Loading Libraries

If you encounter the problem that the library can not be found (output like this)

```
kdb: error while loading shared libraries:
     libelektra-core.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

or:

```
kdb: error while loading shared libraries:
     libelektratools.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

you need to place a configuration file at `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` (e.g. `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/elektra.conf`). Note that under Alpine Linux this file is called `/etc/ld-musl-x86_64.path` or similar, depending on your architecture.

Add the path where the library has been installed (on Alpine Linux this had to be `usr/lib/elektra` for it to work)

```
/usr/lib/local/
```

and run `ldconfig` as root.

## Installation Manuals

For some of the plugins and tools that ship with Elektra,
additional installation manuals have been written.
You can find them in the [tutorial overview](tutorials/README.md).
