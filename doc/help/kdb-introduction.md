kdb-introduction(1) -- introduction to kdb
==========================================

**kdb** provides access to the global key database of Elektra via
command-line.  In this manual we give an overview of the tool suite
`kdb`. It is part of Elektraâ€™s tools. The tool suite `kdb` consists
of individual commands.  Most commands are independent and some commands
are sharing an executable. Some commands are written as external scripts.

The included commands can be listed via:  
`kdb`

External commands can be listed via:  
`kdb list-tools`.

Only a few commands are enough for daily use.
We can retrieve a key by:  
`kdb get user/key`

We store a key permanently with a value given by:  
`kdb set user/key value`

We list all available keys arranged below a key by:  
`kdb ls user/key`
