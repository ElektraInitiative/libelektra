kdb-remount(1) - Use an existing backend to mount a new file
============================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`kdb remount <new path> <new mountpoint> <existing mountpoint>`

Where `new path` is the path to the file the user wants to mount, (Absolute for system files, relative for user files)  
`new mountpoint` is where in the key database the new configuration file should be mounted at, (For a cascading mount pount, `mountpoint` should start with `/`)  
and `existing mountpoint` is the mountpoint where the existing backend is mounted.  

## DESCRIPTION
