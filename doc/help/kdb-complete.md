# kdb-complete(1) -- Show suggestions how to complete a given path

## SYNOPSIS

`kdb complete [path]`

Where `path` is the path for which the user would like to receive completion suggestion.
If `path` is not specified, it will show every possible completion. Its synonymous
to calling `kdb complete ""`.

## DESCRIPTION

Show suggestions how the current name could be completed.
Suggestions will include existing key names, path segments of existing key names,
namespaces and mount points.
Additionally, the output will indicate whether the given path is a node or a leaf
in the hierarchy of keys, nodes end with '/' as opposed to leaves.
It will also work for cascading keys, and will additionally display a cascading
key's namespace in the output to indicate from which namespace this suggestion
originates from.

## OPTIONS

- `-H`, `--help`:
  Show the man page.
- `-V`, `--version`:
  Print version info.
- `-p`, `--profile <profile>`:
  Use a different kdb profile.
- `-C`, `--color <when>`:
  Print never/auto(default)/always colored output.
- `-m`, `--min-depth <min-depth>`:
  Specify the minimum depth of completion suggestions (0 by default), exclusive
  and relative to the name to complete.
- `-M`, `--max-depth <max-depth>`:
  Specify the maximum depth of completion suggestions (unlimited by default, 1
  to show only the next level), inclusive and relative to the name to complete.
- `-v`, `--verbose`:
  Give a more detailed output, showing the number of child nodes and the depth level. Prints additional information in case of errors/warnings.
- `-0`, `--null`:
  Use binary 0 termination.
- `-d`, `--debug`:
  Give debug information. Prints additional debug information in case of errors/warnings.
