# refcount comparison

This folder compares different variants of refcounting.
It is purely for illustrative purposes, changing the refcounting scheme would exceed the scope of our planned API rewrite.
Therefore, the new API will use the same refcounting scheme we currently use ([`ref_inc_dec.c`](./ref_inc_dec.c)).
