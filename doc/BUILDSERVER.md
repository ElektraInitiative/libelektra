# Buildserver

The [Elektra buildserver](https://build.libelektra.org/) handles a variety of
tasks that reaches from testing Pull Requests (PRs) to deploying new versions
of the Elektra homepage.

We reworked our build system to use a more modern Jenkinsfile approach with
benefits such as

- tracking modifications to our build process in SCM
- tracking changes to the build environment
- speeding up builds

.

## Setup

This section aims to give an introduction into this setup.

### Multibranch Pipeline Jobs (libelektra)

We use the Jenkins Job type called
[Multibranch Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/#creating-a-multibranch-pipeline)
provided by the
[Pipeline Multibranch Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Multibranch+Plugin)
for our CI tests called `libelektra`.

Simplified a Multibranch Pipeline Job acts as an umbrella job that spawns
child jobs depending on branch (hence multibranch).
The main purpose of the libelektra job is to scan the repository for
changes to existing branches or to find new ones (for example branches
that are used in PR's).
It also contains the information on how to build the jobs in the form
of a path that points to a Jenkinsfile containing more detailed instructions.
The job also takes care of handling build artifacts that are archived and
cleaning them out once the PR's are closed and a grace period has expired.

Summarized libelektra's job purpose is to combine the where
(our GIT repository), with a when (tracking changes via polling or webhooks)
with a how (pointing to the Jenkinsfile + configuration).

### Jenkinsfiles

Jenkinsfiles describe what actions the build system should execute on what
build slave.
Currently Elektra uses two different files.

#### Jenkinsfile.daily

- Jenkinsfile.daily is for daily maintenance tasks, like cleaning up build servers.
- [Buildjob: libelektra-daily](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra-daily/)
- [Jenkinsfile.daily](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/jenkins/Jenkinsfile.daily)

#### Jenkinsfile

- Triggered on code changes and is for testing changes to the codebase.
- [Buildjob: libelektra](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra/)
- [Jenkinsfile](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/jenkins/Jenkinsfile)

#### DSL

The language used is a groovy based DSL described in the
[Jenkinsfile book](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/).
Most groovy syntax is allowed to describe pipelines in a Jenkinsfile, but it
is executed in a sandbox which might block certain calls.

Since plugins might extend the pool of available commands or variables a full
list of currently available syntax can be seen in
[pipeline
syntax](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra/pipeline-syntax/)
after a login to the build server.
Some functionality is not covered by this page when the responsible plugin is
not implementing it.
Usually an approach similar to what is described on
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51103359/jenkins-pipeline-return-value-of-build-step)
can be used to track down the responsible code inside the providing plugins
source code.

We also provide a number of helper functions in our Jenkinsfiles that are
documented at the function head.
Most common use cases, for example adding a new build with certain cmake flags,
are easy to add because of them.
For example, the configuration that is responsible for the `debian-stable-full`
stage is generated completely by a single helper function called `buildAndTest`:

```groovy
tasks << buildAndTest(
  "debian-stable-full",
  DOCKER_IMAGES.stretch,
  CMAKE_FLAGS_BUILD_ALL +
    CMAKE_FLAGS_BUILD_FULL +
    CMAKE_FLAGS_BUILD_STATIC +
    CMAKE_FLAGS_COVERAGE
  ,
  [TEST.ALL, TEST.MEM, TEST.NOKDB, TEST.INSTALL]
)
```

When adding new stages to the build chain it is generally a good idea to look up
an existing stage which does something similar and adapt it to the new use case.

### Security

Since a malicious PR could easily destroy the build server and slaves or expose
credentials some restrictions are introduced.
Only PR authors that have the right to push to libelektra can modify the
Jenkinsfile and have those changes be respected for the respective branch.

This setting can be modified on the respective build job configuration site.

### Test Environments

We use Docker containers to provide the various test environments.

They are described
[in the repository](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/docker)
and the Jenkinsfile describes how to build them.
If a rebuild of the images is needed is determined by the hash of the
Dockerfile used to describe it.
If it has not changed the build step will be skipped.
In the case that an image needed a build it will afterwards be uploaded into a
private Docker image registry (currently on a7) and thus is shared between all
Docker capable build slaves.

### Tests

We will use the Docker images build as described earlier to run compilations
and tests for Elektra.
This allows us to run tests independent of which nodes are available (as the
environment is portable).

The Jenkinsfile describes the steps used to run tests.
Helper functions for easily adding new tests are available
(buildAndTest, BuildAndTestAsan, ...).

The `withDockerEnv` helper makes sure to print the following information at the
start of a test branch:

- branch name
- build machine
- docker image id

Coverage reports are generated automatically when using the buildAndTest helper
and the appropriate Cmake flags for coverage generation have been set. They are
uploaded to https://doc.libelektra.org/coverage/.

Artifacts from `ctest` are also preserved automatically when using
buildAndTest.
The function also takes care of providing a stage name based path so multiple tests
can not overwrite files that share the same name.

Tests are executed in order dictated by the Jenkinsfile.
In general new tests should be added to the 'full build stage' that will only
run after a standard full test run succeeded.
This saves execution time on the build server for most common errors.

Since there is no strict way to enforce the way tests are added we encourage
you to read the existing configuration and modify existing tests so they suite
your needs.

### Deployment

For runs of the build job that are run in the master branch we also execute
deployment steps after all tests pass.
We use it to build debian packages and move it into the repository on the a7
node.
Additionally we recompile the homepage and deploy it on the a7 node.

## Jenkins Setup

This section describes how to replicate the current Jenkins configuration.

### Jenkins libelektra Configuration

The `libelektra` build job is a multibranch pipeline job.
It is easiest to add via the BlueOcean interface.

Most of the default settings should be ok, however some settings need to be
verified or added to build Elektra correctly:

- In Branch Sources under Behaviors `Filter by name` should be
  added to exclude the `debian` branch from being build.
  The reason for this is that the `debian` branch is not providing a
  Jenkinsfile.
- `Advanced clone behaviors` should be added and the path to the git mirror
  needs to be specified: `/home/jenkins/git_mirrors/libelektra`.
  This reference repository is created and maintained by our
  [daily buildjob](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra-daily/).
- Under Property strategy you can add `Trigger build on pull request comment`.
  `jenkins build (libelektra|all) please` is a good starting point.
  This functionality is provided by the
  [GitHub PR Comment Build Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+PR+Comment+Build+Plugin).
- For Build Configuration you want to specify `by Jenkinsfile` and add the
  script path: `scripts/jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.

### Adding a Jenkins Node

A node needs to have a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed.
Further it should run an SSH (Secure SHell) server.
If you want to provide environments via Docker you need to install that as well.

A `jenkins` user with 47000:47000 ids should be created as this is what is
expected in Docker images.
Additionally a public key authentication should be set up so the jenkins
master can establish an ssh connection with the node.
If the node should be able to interact with Docker the jenkins user should be
added to the `docker` group.

Nodes should be set to only build jobs matching their labels and to be online
as much as possible.
As for labels `gitmirror` should be if you want to cache repositories on this
node.
If Docker is available the `docker` label should be set.

## Understanding Jenkins Output

Our jenkins build uses parallel steps inside a single build job to do most of
the work.
To reliable determine which stages failed it is best to look over the build
results in the Jenkins Blue Ocean view.
It is the default View opened when accessing the build results from GitHub.
For libelektra the URLs are
https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra/ and
https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/blue/organizations/jenkins/libelektra/branches/
.

Failed stages are marked in red.
On selecting a stage you can further expand all steps in the stage.
Of interest should be one of the first steps which echos out the Docker image
used to run the stage.
You also want to look for whatever failed (which should be in a step also marked
red to indicate failure).

## Reproducing Build Server Errors Locally

First you have to determine which image is used.
This is described above in _Understanding Jenkins output_.

Afterwards you can download it from our registry via `docker pull`.
Pay attention that you have to use **hub-public.libelektra.org** as this subdomain
does not require authentication for GET operations used by the Docker client.
As an example:

```sh
docker pull hub-public.libelektra.org/build-elektra-alpine:201809-791f9f388cbdff0db544e02277c882ad6e8220fe280cda67e6ea6358767a065e
```

You can also rebuild the images locally, which is useful if you want to test changes
you made to the Dockerfiles themselves.
Locate which Dockerfile you need by looking up the reference the stage that used it in the Jenkinsfile.
For _alpine_ this would be `DOCKER_IMAGES.alpine`.
You can search for this entry in the Jenkinsfile to find that this image is build from the
context `./scripts/docker/alpine/3.8` and uses `./scripts/docker/alpine/3.8/Dockerfile` as a
Dockerfile.
Now you can build the image as described in
[scripts/docker/README.md](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/docker/README.md#building-images-locally).

You can find more information on how to use our images in
[scripts/docker/README.md](https://master.libelektra.org/scripts/docker/README.md#testing-elektra-via-docker-images).

## Modify Test Environments

You can also modify the test environments (update a dependency, install a new
dependency, ...) by editing the Dockerfiles checked into SCM.
Determine which ones you need to modify by tracing which images are used for
what stages via the `DOCKER_IMAGES` map used in our Jenkinsfile.
The `dockerInit` function should be a good start point.

Following docker best practises you should try to minimize layer count
when possible.
Our docker images are quite large and hence take a long time to build so make
sure to test any modifications locally first.

## Triggers

All Triggers are described in the configuration of the respective build jobs.

The [libelektra](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra/)
build is triggered for all branches of the libelektra repository except for
`debian`.
Additionally all open branches in forks targeting libelektra's repository via
PRs are going to be build.
Pushes to any of those branches will trigger a new build automatically.

The
[daily build](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra-daily/)
is executed according to a cron schedule.

The following phrases can be used as comments to manually trigger a specific
build:

- jenkins build [libelektra](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra/) please
- jenkins build [homepage](https://build.libelektra.org/job/elektra-homepage/) please
- jenkins build [daily](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra-daily/) please
- jenkins build [monthly](https://build.libelektra.org/jenkins/job/libelektra-monthly/) please

Additionally `jenkins build all please` can be used to trigger all build jobs
relevant for PR's.
This is not necessary anymore as all relevant tests have been moved into the libelektra job.

## Authorization

If you are not yet authorized, the following
question will be asked (by user @markus2330):

    Can one of the admins verify if this patch should be build?

Then one of the admins (sorted by activity):

- @sanssecours
- @markus2330
- @beku
- @BernhardDenner
- @fberlakovich
- @manuelm

need to confirm by saying:

    .*add\W+to\W+whitelist.*

or if just the pull request should be checked:

    .*build\W+allow.*

## Issues with the Build Environment

If you have issues that are related to the build system you can open a normal
issue and tag it with `build` and `question`.
If you feel like your inquiry does not warrant an issue on its own, please use
[our buildserver issue](https://issues.libelektra.org/160).
