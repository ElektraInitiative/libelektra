# CODING

This document provides an introduction in how the source code of
libelektra is organized and how and where to add functionality.

Make sure to read [DESIGN](/doc/DESIGN.md) together with this document.

## Folder structure

After you downloaded and unpacked Elektra you should see some folders.
The most important are:

 * **src:** This directory contains the source of the libraries, tools and plugins.
 * **doc:** General documentation for the project and the core library.
 * **examples:** Examples on how to use the core library.
 * **tests:** Contains the testing framework for the source (**src**).

## Source Code

libelektra is the ANSI/ISO C99-Core which coordinates the interactions
between the user and the plugins.

The plugins have all kinds of dependencies. It is the responsibility of
the plugins to find and check them using CMake. The same guidelines
apply to all code in the repository including the plugins.

`libloader` is responsible for loading the backend modules. It works on
various operating systems by using `libltdl`. This code is optimized
for static linking and win32.

kdb is the commandline-tool to access and initialize the Elektra database.

### General Guidelines

You are only allowed to break a guideline if there is a good reason
to do so. When you do, document the fact as comment next to the code.

Of course, all rules of good software engineering apply: Use meaningful
names and keep the software both testable and reusable.

The purpose of the guidelines is to have a consistent
style, not to teach programming.

If you see code that breaks guidelines do not hesitate to fix them. At least put a
TODO marker to make the places visible.

If you see inconsistency within the rules do not hesitate to talk about it with the
intent to add a new rule here.

See [DESIGN](/doc/DESIGN.md) document too, they complement each other.

### Code Comments

Code is not only for the computer, but it should be readable for humans, too.
Up-to-date code comments are essential to make code understandable for others.
Thus please use following techniques (in order of preference):

1. Comment functions with `/**/` and Doxygen, see below.

2. You should also add assertions to state what should be true at a specific
   position in the code. Their syntax is checked and they are automatically
   verified at run-time. So they are not only useful for people reading the
   code but also for tools. Assertions in Elektra are used by:

   `#include <kdbassert.h>`

   `ELEKTRA_ASSERT (condition, "formatted text to be printed when assert fails", ...)`

   Note: Do not use assert for user-APIs, always handle arguments of user-APIs like
   untrusted input.

3. If the "comment" might be useful to be printed during execution, use logging:

   `#include <kdblogger.h>`

   `ELEKTRA_LOG ("formatted text to be printed according log filters", ...)`

   There are four log levels (ERROR is reserved for aborts within `ELEKTRA_ASSERT`):
   - ELEKTRA_LOG_WARNING, something critical that should be shown to the user (e.g. API misuse), see #ELEKTRA_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING
   - ELEKTRA_LOG_NOTICE, something important developers are likely interested in, see #ELEKTRA_LOG_LEVEL_NOTICE
   - ELEKTRA_LOG, standard level gives information what the code is doing without flooding the log, see #ELEKTRA_LOG_LEVEL_INFO
   - ELEKTRA_LOG_DEBUG, for less important logs, see #ELEKTRA_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG

4. Otherwise comment within source with `//` or with `/**/` for multi-line
   comments.

### Coding Style

- Limits

 * Functions should not exceed 100 lines.
 * Files should not exceed 1000 lines.
 * A line should not be longer than 140 characters.

Split up when those limits are reached.
Rationale: Readability with split windows.

- Indentation

 * Use tabs for indentation.
 * One tab equals 8 spaces.

- Blocks

 * Use blocks even for single line statements.
 * Curly braces go on a line on their own on the previous indentation level.
 * Avoid multiple variable declarations at one place.
 * Declare Variables as late as possible, preferable within blocks.

- Naming

 * Use camelCase for functions and variables.
 * Start types with upper-case, everything else with lower-case.
 * Prefix names with `elektra` for internal usage. External API either starts
   with `ks`, `key` or `kdb`.

- Whitespaces

 * Use space before and after equal when assigning a value.
 * Use space before round parenthesis ( `(` ).
 * Use space before and after `*` from Pointers.
 * Use space after `,` of every function argument.

The [reformat script](/scripts/reformat-source) can ensure most code style rules,
but it is obviously not capable of ensuring everything (e.g. naming conventions).
So do not give this responsibility out of hands entirely.

### C Guidelines

 * The compiler shall not emit any warning (or error).
 * Use goto only for error situations.
 * Use `const` as much as possible.
 * Use `static` methods if they should not be externally visible.
 * C-Files have extension `.c`, Header files `.h`.

**Example:** [src/libs/elektra/kdb.c](/src/libs/elektra/kdb.c)

### C++ Guidelines

 * Everything as in C if not noted otherwise.
 * Do not use goto at all, use RAII instead.
 * Do not use raw pointers, use smart pointers instead.
 * C++-Files have extension `.cpp`, Header files `.hpp`.
 * Do not use `static`, but anonymous namespaces.
 * Write everything within namespaces and do not prefix names.
 * Oriented towards [more safe and modern usage](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md).

**Example:** [src/bindings/cpp/include/kdb.hpp](/src/bindings/cpp/include/kdb.hpp)

### Markdown Guidelines

 * File Ending is `.md` or integrated within Doxygen comments
 * Only use `#` characters at the left side of headers/titles
 * Use tabs or fences for code/examples
 * Prefer fences which indicate the used language for better syntax highlighting
 * Fences with sh are for the [shell recorder syntax](/tests/shell/shell_recorder/tutorial_wrapper)
 * `README.md` and tutorials should be written exclusively with shell recorder syntax
   so that we know that the code in the tutorial produces output as expected


### Doxygen Guidelines

`doxygen` is used to document the API and to build the html and pdf output.
We also support the import of Markdown pages. Doxygen 1.8.8 or later
is required for this feature (Anyways you can find the
[API Doc](http://doc.libelektra.org/api/latest/html/) online).
Links between Markdown files will be converted with the
[Markdown Link Converter](/doc/markdownlinkconverter/README.md).
**Markdown pages are used in the pdf, therefore watch which characters you use and
provide a proper encoding!**

 * use `@` to start Doxygen tags
 * Do not duplicate information available in git in Doxygen comments.
 * Use `@copydoc`, `@copybrief` and `@copydetails` intensively (except for file headers).

### File Headers

Files should start with:

\verbatim

	/**
	 * @file
	 *
	 * @brief <short statement about the content of the file>
	 *
	 * @copyright BSD License (see doc/LICENSE.md or https://www.libelektra.org)
	 */

\endverbatim

Note:

- `@` `file` has *no* parameters.
- `@` `brief` should contain a short statement about the content of the file and is needed
  so that your file gets listed at http://doc.libelektra.org/api/latest/html/files.html

The duplication of the filename, author and date is not needed, because
this information is tracked using git and [doc/AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) already.
