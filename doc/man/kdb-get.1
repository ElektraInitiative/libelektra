.
.SH "NAME"
\fBkdb\-get\fR \- Get the value of a key stored in the key database
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkdb get <key name>\fR
.
.P
Where \fBkey name\fR is the name of the key\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command is used to retrieve the value of a key\.
.
.P
If you enter a \fBkey name\fR starting with a leading \fB/\fR, then a cascading lookup will be performed in order to attempt to locate the key\. In this case, using the \fB\-v\fR option allows the user to see the full key name of the key if it is found\.
.
.P
Note: There is a current limitation where only keys that are mounted will be considered during a cascading lookup\. A workaround that will lookup all keys is to pass the \fB\-a\fR option\. Additionally, a user can use the command \fBkdb ls <same key>\fR to see if an override or a fallback will be considered by the lookup\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show the man page\.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version info\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-profile\fR=\fIprofile\fR
Use a different kdb profile\.
.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Consider all of the keys\.
.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-newline\fR
Suppress the newline at the end of the output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Explain what is happening\. Gives a complete trace of all tried keys\. Very useful to debug fallback and overrides\.
.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR=[when]
Print never/auto(default)/always colored output\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To get the value of a key: \fBkdb get user/example/key\fR
.
.P
To get the value of a key using a cascading lookup: \fBkdb get /example/key\fR
.
.P
To get the value of a key without adding a newline to the end of it: \fBkdb get \-n /example/key\fR
.
.P
To explain why a specific key was used (for cascading keys): \fBkdb get \-v /example/key\fR
.
.P
To use bookmarks: \fBkdb get +kdb/format\fR
.
.P
This command will actually get \fBuser/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/format\fR if the bookmarks commands from kdb\-set(1) \fIkdb\-set\.md\fR man pages are executed before\.
