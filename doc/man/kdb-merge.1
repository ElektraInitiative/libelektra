.
.SH "NAME"
\fBkdb\-merge\fR \- Three\-way merge of KeySets
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkdb merge [options] ourpath theirpath basepath resultpath\fR
.
.TP
ourpath
Path to the keyset to serve as \fBours\fR
.
.TP
theirpath
path to the keyset to serve as \fBtheirs\fR
.
.TP
basepath
path to the \fBbase\fR keyset
.
.TP
resultpath
path without keys where the merged keyset will be saved
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Does a three\-way merge between keysets\.
.
.br
On success the resulting keyset will be saved to mergepath\.
.
.br
On unresolved conflicts nothing will be changed\.
.
.SH "THREE\-WAY MERGE"
The \fBkdb merge\fR command uses a three\-way merge by default\.
.
.br
A three\-way merge is when three versions of a file (or in this case, KeySet) are compared in order to automatically merge the changes made to the KeySet over time\.
.
.br
These three versions of the KeySet are:
.
.TP
\fBbase\fR
The \fBbase\fR KeySet is the original version of the KeySet\.
.
.TP
\fBours\fR
The \fBours\fR KeySet represents the user\'s current version of the KeySet\.
.
.br
This KeySet differs from \fBbase\fR for every key you changed\.
.
.TP
\fBtheirs\fR
The \fBtheirs\fR KeySet usually represents the default version of a KeySet (usually the package maintainer\'s version)\.
.
.br
This KeySet differs from \fBbase\fR for every key someone has changed\.
.
.P
The three\-way merge works by comparing the \fBours\fR KeySet and the \fBtheirs\fR KeySet to the \fBbase\fR KeySet\. By looking for differences in these KeySets, a new KeySet called \fBresult\fR is created that represents a merge of these KeySets\.
.
.SH "CONFLICTS"
Conflicts occur when a Key has a different value in all three KeySets\.
.
.br
Conflicts in a merge can be resolved using a \fIstrategy\fR with the \fB\-s\fR option\. To interactively resolve conflicts, use the \fB\-i\fR option\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To complete a simple merge of three KeySets:
.
.br
\fBkdb merge user/ours user/theirs user/base user/result\fR
.
.P
To complete a merge whilst using the \fBours\fR version of the KeySet to resolve conflicts:
.
.br
\fBkdb merge \-s ours user/ours user/theirs user/base user/result\fR
.
.P
To complete a three\-way merge and overwrite all current keys in the \fBresultpath\fR:
.
.br
\fBkdb merge \-s cut user/ours user/theirs user/base user/result\fR
