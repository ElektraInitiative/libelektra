.TH "KDB\-PLUGIN\-CHECK" "1" "October 2019" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBkdb\-plugin\-check\fR \- Perform internal checks
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkdb plugin\-check [<plugin>]\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command is used to perform checks on the key database or an Elektra plugin\.
.
.P
Where the option argument, \fBplugin\fR is the plugin that a user wants to check\. Use \fB\-c\fR to pass options to that plugin\. If no \fBplugin\fR argument is provided a check will be performed on the key database itself\. Special values are returned upon exit to represent the outcome of a check\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show the man page\.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version info\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-profile <profile>\fR
Use a different kdb profile\.
.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-color <when>\fR
Print never/auto(default)/always colored output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
The user can also use this tool to perform write tests\. Please note that this can result in configuration files being changed!
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Explain what is happening\. Prints additional information in case of errors/warnings\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-plugins\-config <plugins\-config>\fR

.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Give debug information\. Prints additional debug information in case of errors/warnings\.
.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
There are two different types of checks, a check on a plugin (by specifying the name of a plugin as an argument) or a check on the key database itself\.
.
.P
The outcome of a check on the key database is returned as an exit status\. This integer represents an 8\-bit pattern\. Each bit represents a specific outcome as described below:
.
.TP
0
No errors (no output)
.
.TP
Bit 1
Warning on opening the key database\.
.
.TP
Bit 2
Error on opening the key database\.
.
.TP
Bit 3
Warning on getting the value of a key\.
.
.TP
Bit 4
Error on getting the value of a key\.
.
.TP
Bit 5
Warning on setting the value of a key\. (only checked when \fB\-f\fR is used)
.
.TP
Bit 6
Error on setting the value of a key (only checked when \fB\-f\fR is used)
.
.TP
Bit 7
Warning on closing the key database\.
.
.TP
Bit 8
Error on closing the key database\.
.
.P
So if the following number was returned \fB9\fR the user could figure out more detail by considering the bits: \fB00001001\fR The user would know that there was a warning on open and an error on get\.
.
.P
If a plugin name is given, checks will only be done on the given plugin\. The returned values for a check on a plugin are returned as much simpler numbers\.
.
.P
Return values on plugin checking:
.
.TP
0
Everything ok\. (no output)
.
.TP
1
No such plugin found or plugin could not be opened\.
.
.TP
2
Plugin did not pass checks\.
.
.TP
3
Plugin has warnings\.
.
.P
Please report any output caused by official plugins to \fIhttps://git\.libelektra\.org/issues\fR\.
.
.P
Since the error code is a return value, it is not automatically displayed to the shell\. If the user wants to have the value printed, they must do so manually (by running a command such as \fBecho $?\fR)\.
.
