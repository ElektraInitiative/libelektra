.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkdb complete [path]\fR
.
.P
Where \fBpath\fR is the path for which the user would like to receive completion suggestion\. If \fBpath\fR is not specified, it will show every possible completion\. Its synonymous to calling \fBkdb complete ""\fR\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Show suggestions how the current name could be completed\. Suggestions will include existing key names, path segments of existing key names, namespaces and mount points\. Additionally, the output will indicate whether the given path is a node or a leaf in the hierarchy of keys, nodes end with \'/\' as opposed to leaves\. It will also work for cascading keys, and will additionally display a cascading key\'s namespace in the output to indicate from which namespace this suggestion originates from\.
.

Print never/auto(default)/always colored output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-min\-depth <min\-depth>\fR
Specify the minimum depth of completion suggestions (0 by default), exclusive and relative to the name to complete\.
.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-max\-depth <max\-depth>\fR
Specify the maximum depth of completion suggestions (unlimited by default, 1 to show only the next level), inclusive and relative to the name to complete\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Give a more detailed output, showing the number of child nodes and the depth level\. Prints additional information in case of errors/warnings\.
