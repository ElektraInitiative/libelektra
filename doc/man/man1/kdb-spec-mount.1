.
.SH "NAME"
\fBkdb\-spec\-mount\fR \- Mount a spec file to the key database
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkdb spec\-mount [/<mountpoint>] [<plugin> [<config>] [\.\.]]\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmountpoint\fR is where in the key database the new backend should be mounted to\. It must be a cascading mountpoint, i\.e\., \fBmountpoint\fR must start with \fB/\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBplugin\fR are extra Elektra plugins to be used (next to the one specified in \fBspec/\fR)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Plugins may be followed by a \fB,\fR separated list of \fBkeys=values\fR pairs which will be used as plugin configuration\.
.

\fBkdb smount\fR is an alias and can be used in the same way as \fBkdb spec\-mount\fR\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command allows a user to mount a new \fIbackend\fR described by a previously mounted specification\. To mount a specification file to \fBspec\fR\-namespace \fIelektra\-namespaces\.md\fR first use kdb\-mount(7) \fIkdb\-mount\.md\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

kdb mount some\-spec\-file\.ini spec/example/mountpoint ni
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The idea of mounting is explained in elektra\-mounting(7) \fIelektra\-mounting\.md\fR\. The \fBspec\fR namespace \fIelektra\-namespaces\.md\fR contains metaconfiguration that describes the configuration in all other namespaces\. The metadata used for the specification is described in METADATA\.ini \fI/doc/METADATA\.ini\fR\.
.
.P
During \fBspec\-mount\fR the \fBspec\fR keys are searched for relevant metadata:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For every metadata \fBmountpoint\fR an additional cascading mountpoint will be mounted\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fBinfos/*\fR and \fBconfig/needs\fR from CONTRACT\.ini \fI/doc/CONTRACT\.ini\fR, that are tagged by \fBusedby = spec\fR, will work as described there\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For other metadata suitable plugins are searched and mounted additionally\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

kdb getmeta spec/example/mountpoint mountpoint  # verify that we have a mountpoint here
kdb spec\-mount /example/mountpoint  # mounts /example/mountpoint according to specification
    # found at spec/example/mountpoint
.
.fi

.SH "IMPORTANT"
This command writes into the \fB/etc\fR directory and as such it requires root permissions\. Use \fBkdb file system/elektra/mountpoints\fR to find out where exactly it will write to\.
.
.P
Note that many specifications have globs like \fB_\fR and \fB#\fR\. They will only work if the \fBspec\fR plugin is present:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

kdb global\-mount

.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-with\-recommends\fR

.
.SH "KDB"
.
.TP
\fB/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/verbose\fR
Same as \fB\-v\fR: Explain what is happening\.
.
.TP

.
.TP
\fB/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/plugins\fR
It contains a space\-separated list of plugins and their configs which are added automatically (by default sync)\. The plugin\-configuration syntax is as described above in the \fIsynopsis\fR\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To mount /example as described in \fBspec/example\fR:
.
.br
\fBkdb spec\-mount /example\fR
.
.P
Additionally, add \fBini\fR plugin (instead of some default resolver) with \fBsome\fR as config:
.
.br
\fBkdb spec\-mount /example ini some=value\fR
