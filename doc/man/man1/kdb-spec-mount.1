.
.SH "NAME"
\fBkdb\-spec\-mount\fR \- Mount a spec file to the key database
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkdb spec\-mount [/<mountpoint>] [<plugin> [<config>] [\.\.]]\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBmountpoint\fR is where in the key database the new backend should be mounted to\. It must be a cascading mount point, i\.e\., \fBmountpoint\fR must start with \fB/\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBplugin\fR are extra Elektra plugins to be used (next to the one specified in \fBspec/<mountpoint>\fR)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Plugins may be followed by a \fB,\fR separated list of \fBkeys=values\fR pairs which will be used as plugin configuration\.
.
.IP "" 0

\fBkdb smount\fR is an alias and can be used in the same way as \fBkdb spec\-mount\fR\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command allows a user to mount a new \fIbackend\fR described by a previously mounted specification\. To mount a specification file to \fBspec\fR\-namespace \fIelektra\-namespaces\.md\fR first use kdb\-mount(7) \fIkdb\-mount\.md\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

sudo kdb mount /path/to/some\-spec\-file\.ini spec/example/mountpoint ni
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The idea of mounting is explained in elektra\-mounting(7) \fIelektra\-mounting\.md\fR\. The \fBspec\fR namespace \fIelektra\-namespaces\.md\fR contains metaconfiguration that describes the configuration in all other namespaces\. The metadata used for the specification is described in METADATA\.ini \fI/doc/METADATA\.ini\fR\.
.
.P
During \fBspec\-mount\fR the \fBspec\fR keys are searched for relevant metadata:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For every metadata \fBmountpoint\fR an additional cascading mount point will be mounted\. The metadata \fBmountpoint\fR is usually at the parent key (the top\-level key of the specification)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fBinfos/*\fR and \fBconfig/needs\fR from CONTRACT\.ini \fI/doc/CONTRACT\.ini\fR, that are tagged by \fBusedby = spec\fR, will work as described there\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
For other metadata suitable plugins are searched and mounted additionally\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

kdb meta\-get spec/example/mountpoint mountpoint  # verify that we have a mountpoint here
sudo kdb spec\-mount /example/mountpoint  # mounts /example/mountpoint according to
                                         # the specification as found at
                                         # spec/example/mountpoint
.
.fi

.SH "IMPORTANT"
This command writes into the \fB/etc\fR directory and as such it requires root permissions\. Use \fBkdb file system/elektra/mountpoints\fR to find out where exactly it will write to\.
.
.P
Note that many specifications have globs like \fB_\fR and \fB#\fR\. They will only work if the \fBspec\fR plugin is present:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

kdb global\-mount

.SH "OPTIONS"
.

\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-color <when>\fR
Print never/auto(default)/always colored output\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Explain what is happening\.
.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress non\-error messages\.
.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-resolver <resolver>\fR
Specify the resolver plugin to use if no resolver is given, the default resolver is used\. See also \fIbelow in KDB\fR\. Note that the resolver will only added as dependency, but not directly added\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-plugins\-config <plugins\-config>\fR
Add a plugin configuration for all plugins\.
.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-with\-recommends\fR
Also add recommended plugins and warn if they are not available\.
.
.SH "KDB"
.
.TP
\fB/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/verbose\fR
Same as \fB\-v\fR: Explain what is happening\.
.
.TP
\fB/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/quiet\fR
Same as \fB\-q\fR: Suppress default messages\.
.
.TP
\fB/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/resolver\fR
The resolver that will be added automatically, if \fB\-R\fR is not given\.
.
.TP
\fB/sw/elektra/kdb/#0/current/plugins\fR
It contains a space\-separated list of plugins and their configs which are added automatically (by default sync)\. The plugin\-configuration syntax is as described above in the \fIsynopsis\fR\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
To mount /example as described in \fBspec/example\fR:
.
.br
\fBsudo kdb spec\-mount /example\fR
.
.P
Additionally, add \fBini\fR plugin (instead of some default resolver) with a config for INI:
.
.br
\fBsudo kdb spec\-mount /example ini section=NULL\fR
