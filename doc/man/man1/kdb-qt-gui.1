.SH "Introduction"
The tool \fBqt\-gui\fR offers a graphical interface for users of Elektra\. It allows users to create, manage, edit, and delete keys stored in the global key database (KDB)\.
.SH "Compiling and Installation"
.SS "Dependencies"
In order to compile and use the new \fBqt\-gui\fR there are a few dependencies which must be installed\.
.IP "\(bu" 4
qt5\.3 or greater
.IP "\(bu" 4
libdrm\-dev
.IP "\(bu" 4
libdiscount (libmarkdown2\-dev)
.IP "\(bu" 4
the following qt5 modules: \fBquickcontrols\fR \fBdeclarative\fR (\fBqtdeclarative5\-dev\fR)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Alternatively, you may need \fBsudo apt\-get install qml\-module\-qt\-labs\-folderlistmodel\fR and \fBsudo apt\-get install qml\-module\-qt\-labs\-settings\fR

.P
Optional dependencies are (are automatically deactivated if dependencies are not found):
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBQt5Svg\fR for SVG icon themes (\fBsudo apt\-get install libqt5svg5\-dev\fR)
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBQt5DBus\fR so that \fBqt\-gui\fR will be notified on changes\.
.IP "" 0
.P
I was able to install the correct dependencies on my system, running Kubuntu 14\.10 using the command: \fBsudo apt\-get install qt5\-default qml\-module\-qtquick\-controls qml\-module\-qtquick\-dialogs qml\-module\-qtquick\-layouts qml\-module\-qtgraphicaleffects libdrm\-dev libmarkdown2\-dev libqt5svg5\-dev\fR
.SS "Change Notification"
It is recommended to use the viewer mode if DBus notifications are expected\. Use "Settings \-> Viewermode" to activate the viewermode\.
.P
To publish changes to KDB via DBus use:
.P
\fBkdb global\-mount dbus\fR
.P
\fBqt\-gui\fR also subscribes to DBus notifications and automatically synchronizes the configuration when notified\.
.P
Known Issue: On reload the current element in the tree view gets unselected, you need to click on the element of interest again\.
.SS "Compiling"
Compile Elektra as normal as per the COMPILE document \fI/doc/COMPILE\.md\fR making sure to include the \fBqt\-gui\fR tool using the \fB\-DTOOLS\fR flag\.
.P
For instance: \fB\-DTOOLS=ALL\fR or \fB\-DTOOLS=qt\-gui\fR
.P
Note: If you install qt5 manually, you must either:
.IP "\(bu" 4
make sure the qt5 libraries are included in \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
OR make sure to specify \fB\-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt5\.3\.0/5\.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake\fR
.IP "" 0
.SS "Installing"
You can now install Elektra as you normally would or as described in the install documentation \fI/doc/INSTALL\.md\fR\. The package is called \fBelektra\-qt\-gui\fR\.
