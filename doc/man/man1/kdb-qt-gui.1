.SH "Introduction"
The tool \fBqt\-gui\fR offers a graphical interface for users of Elektra\. It allows users to create, manage, edit, and delete keys stored in the global key database (KDB)\.
.
.SH "Compiling and Installation"
.
.SS "Dependencies"
In order to compile and use the new \fBqt\-gui\fR there are a few dependencies which must be installed\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
qt5\.3 or greater
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
libdrm\-dev
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
libdiscount (libmarkdown2\-dev)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
the following qt5 modules: \fBquickcontrols\fR \fBdeclarative\fR (\fBqtdeclarative5\-dev\fR)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Alternatively, you may need \fBsudo apt\-get install qml\-module\-qt\-labs\-folderlistmodel\fR and \fBsudo apt\-get install qml\-module\-qt\-labs\-settings\fR

Optional dependencies are (are automatically deactivated if dependencies are not found):
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBQt5Svg\fR for SVG icon themes (\fBsudo apt\-get install libqt5svg5\-dev\fR)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBQt5DBus\fR so that \fBqt\-gui\fR will be notified on changes\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
I was able to install the correct dependencies on my system, running Kubuntu 14\.10 using the command: \fBsudo apt\-get install qt5\-default qml\-module\-qtquick\-controls qml\-module\-qtquick\-dialogs qml\-module\-qtquick\-layouts qml\-module\-qtgraphicaleffects libdrm\-dev libmarkdown2\-dev libqt5svg5\-dev\fR
.
.SS "Change Notification"
It is recommended to use the viewer mode if DBus notifications are expected\. Use "Settings \-> Viewermode" to activate the viewermode\.
.
.P
To publish changes to KDB via DBus use:
.
.P
\fBkdb global\-mount dbus\fR
.
.P
\fBqt\-gui\fR also subscribes to DBus notifications and automatically synchronizes the configuration when notified\.
.
.P
Known Issue: On reload the current element in the tree view gets unselected, you need to click on the element of interest again\.
.
.SS "Compiling"
Compile Elektra as normal as per the COMPILE document \fI/doc/COMPILE\.md\fR making sure to include the \fBqt\-gui\fR tool using the \fB\-DTOOLS\fR flag\.
.
.P
For instance: \fB\-DTOOLS=ALL\fR or \fB\-DTOOLS=qt\-gui\fR
.
.P
Note: If you install qt5 manually, you must either:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
make sure the qt5 libraries are included in \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
OR make sure to specify \fB\-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt5\.3\.0/5\.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake\fR
.
.IP "" 0

.SS "Installing"
