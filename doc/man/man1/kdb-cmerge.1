\fBkdb\-cmerge\fR \- Three\-way merge of KeySets

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBkdb cmerge\fR can incorporate changes from two modified versions (our and their) into a common preceding version (base) of a key set\. This lets you merge the sets of changes represented by the two newer key sets\. This is called a three\-way merge between key sets\.
.
.br
On success the resulting keyset will be saved to mergepath\.
.
.br
On unresolved conflicts nothing will be changed\.
.
.br
This tool currently exists alongside \fBkdb merge\fR until it is completely ready to supersede it\. At this moment, cmerge will be renamed to merge\.
.
.SH "THREE\-WAY MERGE"
You can think of the three\-way merge as subtracting base from their and adding the result to our, or as merging into our the changes that would turn base into their\. Thus, it behaves exactly as the GNU diff3 tool\. These three versions of the KeySet are:
.
.br
.
.TP
\fBbase\fR
The \fBbase\fR KeySet is the original version of the key set\.
.
.br

.
.TP
\fBour\fR
The \fBour\fR KeySet represents the user\'s current version of the KeySet\.
.
.br
This KeySet differs from \fBbase\fR for every key you changed\.
.
.br

.
.TP
\fBtheir\fR
The \fBtheir\fR KeySet usually represents the default version of a KeySet (usually the package maintainer\'s version)\.
.
.br
This KeySet differs from \fBbase\fR for every key someone has changed\.
.
.br

.
.P
The three\-way merge works by comparing the \fBour\fR KeySet and the \fBtheir\fR KeySet to the \fBbase\fR KeySet\. By looking for differences in these KeySets, a new KeySet called \fBresult\fR is created that represents a merge of these KeySets\.
.
.br
.
.SH "CONFLICTS"
Conflicts occur when a key has a different value in all three key sets or when only base differs\. When all three values for a key differ, we call this an overlap\. Different merge strategies \fIelektra\-cmerge\-strategy\.md\fR exist to resolve those conflicts\.
.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
To complete a simple merge of three KeySets:
