Some ideas which should be decided until 1.0


== API Changes ==

Avoid anything starting with _
	_KDB, _KeySet, _Key typedefs

remove elektraInvokeInitialize compatibility layer

Single Interface: only get pointers, no memcopy (only one keyGetString, no
	keyString)

remove old metadata get/set

size_t, ssize_t are not fixed size, use uint32_t.. to have no
	problems on binary serialisation + unified behaviour (array sizes..)

KEY_* -> ELEKTRA_KEY_* to avoid clashes
	e.g. clash with KEY_MODE in “linux/input-event-codes.h”
	consistently use singular (KEY_FLAGS -> KEY_FLAG)


== TOOLS ==

remove legacy configuration of the `kdb` tool
	(% profile and /sw/kdb/ in src/tools/kdb/cmdline.cpp line 290-300)


= FINISH for 1.0.0 =

all exported methods of elektra need to be:
	useful in current state
	well documented in behavior
	having test cases for behavior
	behavior not overlapping with another function
	well documented error cases and return values
	having test cases for error cases
	otherwise fix or mark it obsolete

only exported symbols should be available
Version info
release
minimize API -> (split core and convenience like libmetadata)

added API evolution for all parts+declare every API stable+METADATA+CONTRACT stable

make list of all symbols
	exported symbols
	reduce it hard
	symbole, only export (otherwise static)
	Version info 4.0
