This describes what to do for a release:

== Manual Testing ==

- fuzz checker
- memleaks
- ASAN

If no release critical problems are found during testing, continue.

= Tasks before Release =

== Updates ==

- Update doc/COMPILE.md to reflect actually tested setups
- Run scripts/dev/update-infos-status with arguments for heuristics (--auto) and check
  transitions in plugin status: especially from/to experimental
- Write release notes without hash sums (move to final name, add links where to download release)
- cp doc/todo/NEWS.md doc/news/_preparation_next_release.md

== Increment Version Number ==

- CMakeLists.txt
- Increment version in output of doc/tutorials/hello-elektra.md
- Increment <Version> of libelektra5j in examples/external/java/read-keys-example/pom.xml and src/bindings/jna/README.md
- Change VERSION variable in build-server:
  - Go to https://build.libelektra.org
  - Select "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System"
  - Scroll down until "Global Properties" and change the variable VERSION

== Check ==
- https://build.libelektra.org/job/libelektra/job/master/ must pass

= When Source Code is considered ready =

- Trigger release pipeline with parameters:
  The revision parameters should be set to 1 (default).
  On a package revision release (version does not change, only package revision) the revision parameters need to be incremented.
- Download artifacts after release build is finished and pipeline waits for input:
  To download the artifacts either open the "Artifacts" tab on Blue Ocean or open this URL
  https://build.libelektra.org/job/libelektra-release/<BUILD_NUMBER>/artifact/artifacts/
  where <BUILD_NUMBER> is the number of the current pipeline job which can be found at https://build.libelektra.org/job/libelektra-release in the "Build-History" (bottom-left) beginning with "#"
- Inspect the logs from the artifacts
  For each distribution two artifact folder exist: "<DISTRO_CODENAME>" and "<DISTRO_CODENAME>-installed"
  "<DISTRO_CODENAME>-installed" contains the test and strace logs of Elektra installed through the built packages
  For <DISTRO_CODENAME> artifact:
    - [ ] Error logs (*.error) must be empty
    - [ ] Check in the (test-*) folders if the passed tests really were successful, i.e.:
      - [ ] do not contain error output
      - [ ] were not skipped
    - [ ] Check if version is correct in the version file
    - [ ] Check if the package build log has warnings (<DISTRO_CODENAME>/elektra_*.build and <DISTRO_CODENAME>/elektra_*.error)
    - [ ] Check if all plugins/bindings/tools that are part of a package were included (<DISTRO_CODENAME>/elektra_*.build)
  For <DISTRO_CODENAME>-installed artifact:
    - [ ] Check in the (test-*) folders if the passed tests really were successful, i.e.:
      - [ ] do not contain error output
      - [ ] were not skipped
- Inspect the changes to the libelektra git repository in git/master.log
  - [ ] Check diff of commit "release: regenerate plugins overview picture" and if
        doc/images/plugins.pdf was generated correctly
  - [ ] Check diff of commit "release: update plugin info status": Plugin tags should be sorted (optional commit)
  - [ ] Check diff of commit "release: update debian/changelog": Changelog should have a new entry for this release
  - [ ] Check diff of commit "release: update fedora/changelog": Changelog should have a new entry for this release

= Publish =

- Publish packages and artifacts from the pipeline:
  - Go to the classic Jenkins UI at https://build.libelektra.org/job/libelektra-release (BlueOcean sometimes doesn't show the Input step on long pipelines)
  - Select "Paused for Input" on the side menu
  - On the prompt "Publish Release?" select "Yes" to publish the artifacts
- Verify that debs.libelektra.org and rpms.libelektra.org contain the released packages.
- Complete release notes:
  - Clean the git statistics in git/statistics and add them to the release notes (formatting, remove uninteresting data)
  - Add download links to release notes (api-docu, release tarball)
  - Add hash sums to release notes
- Run linkchecker to verify that all download links of the current release are working:
  mkdir build && cd build && make html && ../scripts/link-checker external-links.txt
- Wait for master build to finish and verify website is correct

== Preperation for next release ==

- Increment CMPVERSION in scripts/build/run_icheck
- Cleanup tests/icheck.suppression (and add info to release notes)

== Update Alpine Linux image on docker hub ==

Now that the release is available to download, rebuild the Alpine release image.

To do so, increment the Elektra version in e.g. `scripts/docker/alpine/3.12/release.Dockerfile`:
```
ELEKTRA_RELEASE=0.9.4
```
If the file does not exist, possibly the Alpine version was changed.

== Announce ==

send out release mails&post on social media (see github issue #676)
