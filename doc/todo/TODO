This is a list of TODO items which do not fit in
the other TODO categories.


== VARIANTS ==

for python plugin
 - fix symbol generator
 - avoid full/static for symbol clashes


== errno ==

better errnostore solution?
	reset errno in user functions and avoid code in every plugin
	always provide last errno in ADD_WARNING+SET_ERROR
	use safe implementation see
	https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/c70e92e98d34e14b1e1310a10677b7c0f6e2b54c
	(even strerrno_r seems to deadlock from time to time because of translations?)


== inotify ==

get list of involved configuration files and do inotify on it


== ALGORITHM ==


aka distributor+filebackend plugin
(currently directly in core)
change to proper 2phase algorithm?

kdbGet
* only run on those parts where needed (not only shortcut on nothing changed)
* create an error if no kdbGet was done (no plugin added)

kdbSet
* do not run on empty configuration
* but remove config file instead
* create an error if no kdbSet was done (no plugin added)





== DATA STRUCTURES ==

Only implement what is really needed.
(can take some time to do it well!)
See also OPTIMISE

ksForEach (ks, func, handle)
	void func (Key*, void* handle);
	also with lambdas in c++ (check if external loop is faster?)

ksLookup: value keys only
	with relations
	only in the same folder (sibling)
	only below the current folder (below)

merge + split configuration
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)

allow to change behaviour of keyset using callbacks:
	collect statistics which keys were used and modified how often
	allow tracing of individual (non-removed) keys

KeySet* ksUnion
ksIntersection
ksMerge

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)
ksComplement (Difference, SymmetricDifference)

ksCopy -> ksAssign
ksPopCurrent

InsertIterator
	ksAppend() in O(1)
	KDB_O_NOALL could use binary search

AccessIterator
	not integrated
	ksCurrent only for iterator
	feature for error handling needed?
	functors and same level iterators build on top of it

=== Data transformation ===

use Key's refcount to put it into different data structures

- property tree
- json objects
