This page describes optimization tasks for the current release.

general:
	scripts for performance and stability testing
	testing optimizations (-O2)
	profile the code and fix optimization leaks
	benchmark first!


== mmap storage ==

Cow keys for mmap storage



== SEARCH ==

profiler:
	search for slow parts

elektraMalloc trace:
	reduce elektraMallocs

keySet:
	make statistics how many keys typical applications need
	be efficient for typical needs

== metadata ==

Because metadata is often the same accross many keys we introduced a way to share it.
heap profiling of a large keyset with/without shared metadata

examine "benchmark" again, maybe some more interesting things are hidden there...

== EXCEPTION ==

do not throw exceptions within checker plugins (or fix benchmark)


== OPTIMIZE ==

Key unchanged always checked correctly?

check if anything was really changed making key dirty

optimize a key to use a single elektraMalloc
	(under typical circumstances)
	have all memory of a Key in a single allocation block
	or use internally memory management which can be in mmap?
	-> especially useful for keyNew

dynamic memory management:
	improve realloc, use srealloc
	don't use sprintf, asprintf, strdup, strndup
	use only own functions where available
	use different compilers, libc too

ksAppend() in O(1)

KDB_O_NOALL could use binary search

iconv:
	open handles in kdbOpen? (depending on kdbOpen optimization that it is only done when needed)


== OTHER ==

getString in C++

optimization: single elektraMalloc per key, name unchangeable?
	Mmap custom storage, cow, realloc only when too large
	Limit: only do when necessary!!


== BENCHMARK TESTS ==

iteration
multiple type checkers overhead?
insertion (dump::serialise)
null ptr checks
many mountpoints
many globbing statements

== DATA STRUCTURES ==

Implement order preserving perfect hashing functions
	O(1) lookup, but keep O(n) ordered iteration
	http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.5566&rep=rep1&type=pdf
	ksLookup(,, KDB_O_HASH) or KDB_O_HASH_HEURISTIC to avoid
	rebuilding on seldom lookups
	if hash is available it will be used regardless of options
