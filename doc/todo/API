On potential changes of the API/ABI, please check following list:

- Must have been in kdbproposal.h in the previous release
- Full Doxygen docu (all parameters, brief, long, examples)
- Full Testcoverage
- Still ABI/API compatible
- All Bindings written
- TODO add what needs to be done for symbol versioning
- #ifdef for ELEKTRA_API present?
