On potential changes of the API/ABI as detected by
[`elektra-icheck`](https://build.libelektra.org/job/elektra-icheck),
please check following list:

- API is reviewed
- Full Doxygen docu (all parameters, brief, long, examples)
- Full Testcoverage
- Still ABI/API forward-compatible
  (It is okay to break backward-compatible to add new symbols)
- All Bindings written/work (only if bindings exist for the module)
- Change is mentioned in the release notes
- #ifdef experimental feature present
- symbol versioning done correctly? (./doc/dev/symbol-versioning.md)
