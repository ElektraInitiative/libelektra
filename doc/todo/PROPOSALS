This is a list of TODO items where it is unclear
if it is desirable to have them.
Please create an issue if you favor these ideas.


people that belong to the group can write to system/spec
	@krit0n proposed:
		$ sudo groupadd elektra
		$ KDB_SYSTEM=$(dirname $(kdb file system))
		$ sudo chown -R :elektra  ${KDB_SYSTEM}
		# sudo chmod g+s ${KDB_SYSTEM} # does not work in ubuntu
		$ sudo chmod -R g+w ${KDB_SYSTEM}
		$ sudo usermod -aG elektra ${USER}
	Problems:
		- is kind of a subset of what sudo currently does
		- a quite different approach to current UNIX ideas
		  (currently you need to be root to modify /etc)

chroot
	-c option which allows you to chroot before doing operation
	-u options which allows you to switch user (by setting env internally)
	Problems:
		- already possible by chaining commands


ksLookup (      ADD_IF_MISSING|NEW_KEY):
	add a key and return it, if it was not found
	very common operation
	Problems:
		does not play nicely with hashmap
