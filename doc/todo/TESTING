## error

test that error codes are set correctly
	multiple plugins
	multiple kdbGet/kdbSet calls

test failing mount with error plugin

test error plugin when mounted at open


## yajl

array:
	together with yajl
	check if its a valid array via metadata
	spec/array metadaten: array=1-10
	user/array/#0 -> valid
	user/array -> invalid
	system/array/x -> invalid

## conflicts

fix testkdb_conflict:
	longer get/set sequences
	also with file/non-file
	also with more than 2 KDB

## afl

test all plugins with it

## errno

check if errno is never changed

## fork

fork-safety?
https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/wiki/fish's-Fork-and-Pthread-Manifesto


## test ##

full coverage of all plugins in end-to-end test
	create a directory value rewriter for ini+yajl

test libelektratools:
	addPlugin(Plugin) tests
	usePath functionality?


trailingslashes in TMPDIR?

## fuzz testing

- for configuration files (import)
- using kdb shell
- using kdb mount spec


== ABI compatability tests ==

need defined set of tests which only use tests.h (and not internal,..)
deploy them correctly and run old tests with new elektra

symbols:
	check exported symbols
	use symbol table


make list of all symbols
	exported symbols
	reduce it hard
	symbole, only export (sonst static)
	Version info 4.0

== integration tests ==

run-tests run-shell-tests

kdb convert
converting (any to any storage plugin)

locales

all commandline parameters
	compatibility tests

== LEVELS ==

make different levels of testing:
core tests
test with shell scripts (all of them modify kdb)
test with shell scripts that modify in-build (external, gen)

Goal: allow to install scripts even if running them does not work
(during package creation)

== cpptests ==

make common cmake test infrastructure for cpp plugin tests
needed in: type, dump (currently no tests)

== srcdir ==

Currently a srcdir is defined, but no dir to write to
needed for fstab, dump and so on tests..

== testmod ==

most plugins do not use PLUGIN_OPEN interface
most plugins (especially storage) do only basic or no tests
	dump
	fstab
	hosts

= Missing Testcases =

test cases for locking file

more testcases for kdb interface
	also mount! and check for functionality regressions
	ls over multiple mountpoints

hosts typesafe with plugins enabled

iterator interface (+document better)

ksNext should be safe to missusage?

cursor placement:
	ksCut within cutted area
	ksAppend

backends below other: ls does not work recursively
also ls above multiple plugins

and execute the kdb test functions
(but reduce #)

Partly written configuration tests?
	(rollback at commit?)
converting of config files (automated tests)

== ADVANCED ==

testing coverage:
	-fprofile-arcs
	-ftest-coverage
	reasoning which parts are tested

advanced testing:
	get and set a real big amount of keys
	multithreading testing


testing framework step by step
	with all metadata
	with all calling combinations
	(test driven development)

see if config file does proper roundtrips

== scripts ==

script testing:
	should be runned by make test
	should be available at tarket (be installed)
	can be everything directly at the kdb commandline tool
	should be able to run tests for all plugins +
	different combination of plugins
	should support partly installations and/or builds (not all plugins)
	line number (maybe not important)
	modularity (testing where the code is) (maybe not important)
		-> plugin specifica might be tested at other level/only C
		-> how to do without need of capabilities again? backends at serialization level?? (like with mount)

import/export:
	with all plugins
	with automated kdb tests

kdb testcases:
	for mount/umount
	for import/export/convert
	using chroot

ABI unit tests: (manually)
	install old unit tests with new elektra for ABI tests
