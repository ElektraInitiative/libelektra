Lacking documentation for current releases.

currently following resources are available:
	github showing READMEs
	thesis (running out of date!, lacking some parts already)
	API (overview and big picture missing, not linked with thesis)

Thesis should be:
	brought up to date
	build as official part
	integrated with rest of documentation

Alternative:
	Make homepage with all information
	Using doxygen?

This document describes what is missing in the documentation






== ISSUES ==

tutorials missing

document return value of resolver + other plugins

rewind not clearly defined:
	rewind before plugins?
	rewind after plugins?
	rewind after get()?
	rewind after set()?
	-> write pre+postconditions

not clearly defined how config file is opened
	(temporary file needs to be opened write+create)

relative key names not explained


== DOCUMENTATION ==

all exported methods of elektra need to be:
	useful in current state
	well documented in behavior
	having test cases for behavior
	behavior not overlapping with another function
	well documented error cases, return and errno values
	having test cases for error cases
	otherwise fix or mark it obsolete

add projects using elektra
