# elektra-web Use Cases

The path through the use cases is as follows:

- [Setup instance](./UC_setup_instance.md)
- [View config](./UC_view_config.md)

Now we are in the main part of the application, and we can do the following use cases:

- [Adding keys](./UC_adding_keys.md)
- [Modifying keys](./UC_modifying_keys.md)
- [Drag & Drop keys](./UC_drag_n_drop.md)
- [Finding keys](./UC_finding_keys.md)

Any of these use cases (except for finding because no change is made), are extended by the [Key validation](./UC_key_validation.md) use case. After doing any of these use cases, we can do the [Undo/Redo](./UC_undo_redo.md) use case to revert them.
