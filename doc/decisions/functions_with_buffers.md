# Functions copying into buffers

## Problem
Currently the way functions like keyGetName() work is by passing a buffer with 
a maxSize and if the buffer is large enough, the value gets copied into the 
buffer. This leads to the user having to write a lot of surrounding boilerplate 
code, checking for the size of every value / name they want to copy into a buffer.

## Constraints

## Assumptions

## Considered Alternatives

## Decision

- Remove Functions:
  - keyGetName()
  - keyGetUnescapedName()
  - keyGetBaseName()
  - keyGetString()
  - keyGetBinary()
- add documentation that you should use strncpy() / memcpy() instead:
```c
// str values
strncpy(..., keyName (k), ...)
// binary values
memcpy(..., keyValue (k), ...)
```

## Rationale
The functions clutter the API and try to replace existing builtin functionality 
for little to no gain. This makes the API leaner while also retaining its 
functionality.
