# Arrays

## Problem

Currently multiple warnings are saved in an elektra non-conforming array
notation which is limited to 100 entries. The notation of `#00` is against
the design [decision made](array.md).

## Constraints

## Assumptions

## Considered Alternatives

## Decision

The format should be aligned with the correct array notation,
starting with `#0`. The maximum number of warnings will stay at
100 entries (`#0` - `#_99`).

## Rationale

## Implications

To keep the ordering we add an underscore `_` once we go to
beyond 10 warnings (`#_10`).
