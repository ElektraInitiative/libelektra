# Plugins Ordering

You should first read [elektra-plugins](/src/plugins/) to get
an idea about plugins.

This document describes how [elektra-plugins](/src/plugins/) are
ordered with [elektra-backends(7)](/doc/help/elektra-backends.md).

Multiple plugins open up many ways in which they can be arranged.
A simple way is to have one array with pointers to plugins. To store a
`KeySet`, the first plugin starts off with the `KeySet` passed to it.
The resulting `KeySet` is given to the next plugin. This is repeated
for every plugin in the array.

To obtain a `KeySet`, the array of plugins is processed the other way
round. An empty `KeySet` is passed to the last plugin. The resulting
`KeySet` is handed over to the previous one until the first plugin
is executed.

This approach has shown not to be powerful enough to express all use
cases by counter-evidence. Logging should take place after the storage
plugin performs its actions in both directions. It is not possible to
do this with a _single array_ processed in a way as described above.

## Separated lists

Two individual lists (get+set list) of plugins solve the described problem.
Instead of bidirectional processing of
a single list two separate arrays are used. It turns out that error
scenarios also make this approach unsuccessful. When a plugin fails,
no other plugin must be executed later on because it might depend on the
previous plugin to work correctly. In `kdbGet()`, this works well --
the update process will be stopped. But during `kdbSet()`, changes to
the file system must be reverted. Plugins can leave a lock, temporary
file or journal. These resources need to be cleaned up properly.

## Error List

So every backend additionally needs a third array that is executed in
error scenarios during `kdbSet()`. Plugins responsible for the cleanup,
rollback or error notification are inserted into it.

The resolver plugin requires this error list to do a proper rollback.
Another use case is logging after a failure has happened.

## Arrays of linked lists

A disadvantage of using arrays is that they contain a fixed amount of slots. This means 
that when a certain amount of slots is full, it is no longer possible to add more. 
Therefore, the plugin arrays are structured as arrays of linked lists. 

Each plugin role is assigned its own slot in the array, which contains a linked list. Plugins
fulfilling that role are added to the list. That way, much greater and more flexible plugin 
numbers can be added to a single role.

## Placements

The ordering of plugins inside these three arrays is controlled by
[elektra-contracts(7)](/doc/help/elektra-contracts.md).
Each of the three arrays has one slot for each role. These slots have
names to be referred to in the contract.

Here you see a table that contains all names:

| Slot | Error        | Get            | Set           |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| 0    | prerollback  | getresolver    | setresolver   |
| 1    | rollback     | pregetstorage  | presetstorage |
| 2    | postrollback | getstorage     | setstorage    |
| 3    |              | postgetstorage | precommit     |
| 4    |              |                | commit        |
| 5    |              |                | postcommit    |

How the placement is influenced using `infos/placement`, `infos/ordering`
and `infos/stacking` is described in
[CONTRACT.ini](/doc/CONTRACT.ini).
